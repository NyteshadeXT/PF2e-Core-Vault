Otherwise, the GM will not specify.                                                                               |     |
| [[Sense Motive]] `pf2:1`   | **[[Concentrate]] [[Secret]]** Choose one creature. The GM makes secret [perception](skills#Perception) check vs. Deception DC.

Fail: You detect what it wants you to believe or think they’re behaving normally. Crit. Fail. You get a false sense of its intentions. You typically can’t try again until the situation changes significantly. |     |

| [[Strike]] `pf2:1`         | **[[Attack]]** You attack with a weapon you’re wielding within its given range. If you critically succeed on the attack roll, you double the number of damage dice rolled for the damage pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| [[Take Cover]] `pf2:1`     | If you would have standard [Cover](../../../Other_Effects/Effect_Cover.md), you gain greater [Cover](../../../Other_Effects/Effect_Cover.md), (+4 circumstance bonus to AC; Reflex saves vs. area effects; and Stealth checks to [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or avoid [[Detection]]. Otherwise, you gain standard [Cover](../../../Other_Effects/Effect_Cover.md) (+2). This lasts until you move from current space, attack, become [[Unconscious]], or end as a free action.                                                                           |     |
