Emberhold is a city-state established within the caldera of an active volcano. The city-state leverages the heat and geothermal energy from the volcanic core to fuel its industry, provide warmth, and enhance its defenses.  Emberhold is built within a volcanic caldera, surrounded by steep cliffs and jagged peaks that form natural barriers against invaders.  The city utilizes the volcanic heat for various purposes, including forging metals, powering industry, and generating heat and energy for the city.  Emberhold's architecture is a combination of volcanic stone and metal, creating a stark yet imposing aesthetic.

The Conclave of Inferno consists of influential blacksmiths, alchemists, fire mages, and military leaders who govern the city-state. The conclave oversees the production of enchanted weapons and artifacts, as well as the training of the city's elite military forces. The Conclave of Inferno plays a central role in maintaining order, directing the city's industry, and ensuring the safety and prosperity of Emberhold's inhabitants.  Emberhold is renowned for its skilled blacksmiths and alchemists who use the volcanic heat to craft exceptional weapons, armor, and magical artifacts.
