A coastal kingdom that has thrived despite the challenges posed by the meteor strike. The kingdom's coastal location and skilled sky sailors, traders, and shipbuilders have allowed it to adapt and harness the unique opportunities presented by the changing world. Valoria is situated along a rugged coastline, featuring natural harbors and coves that provide safe ports for the kingdom's ships and sky vessels.Â  The kingdom's terrain includes coastal cliffs, sandy beaches, and rolling hills that gradually rise towards the interior of the land.

Valoria's capital city, Port Maris, serves as the heart of the kingdom's trade and naval operations, boasting grand docks and shipyards that produce some of the finest vessels in Aetheria. Valoria is renowned for its sky sailors, who navigate the winds and currents of the skies with exceptional skill and precision. The kingdom's shipbuilders create not only seafaring vessels but also skyships capable of traversing the fractured skies. These skyships play a key role in trade, exploration, and defense. Valoria's naval fleet combines traditional seafaring ships with modern skyships, giving the kingdom a strategic advantage in both maritime and aerial engagements.

Small Dungeons scattered along Valoria's shores provide valuable resources and magical power. The kingdom has established outposts and research facilities near these Dungeons to study and harness their potential. Queen Mariselle's government carefully monitors and manages the use of Dungeon Seeds, ensuring that their power is used responsibly and does not fall into the wrong hands. Queen Mariselle rules with a steady hand, maintaining a delicate balance of power between the noble houses and merchant guilds that compete for influence within the kingdom. The noble houses oversee various aspects of governance, such as defense, law, and infrastructure, while the merchant guilds dominate trade, finance, and industry. The queen's council includes representatives from both noble and merchant factions, allowing her to mediate disputes and reach compromises to maintain stability in the kingdom.

Valoria's economy thrives on trade, both by sea and sky, with the kingdom serving as a major hub for goods and information flowing through Aetheria. The kingdom's skilled traders engage in commerce with neighboring regions, bartering for resources such as precious metals, magical artifacts, and exotic goods. Valoria's artisans are known for their craftsmanship, producing finely crafted weapons, armor, and luxury items that are sought after across the fractured world.

Valoria's people take pride in their seafaring and skyfaring heritage, celebrating festivals and events that honor their sailors and explorers. The kingdom's architecture reflects its coastal roots, with buildings featuring nautical motifs and designs inspired by the sea. Valoria's cuisine incorporates a rich variety of seafood, as well as flavors from distant lands brought back by its traders and sailors.
