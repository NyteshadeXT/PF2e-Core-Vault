## Overview

> [!Overview|info] 
> The Arcane Exchange Consortium is a sprawling global network thriving on the symbiosis between seekers, magical artisans, and curious townsfolk. Their motto, "From Core to Crown, We Shape Destiny," encapsulates their mission. The Consortium purchases Creature Cores and unwanted magical artifacts from daring seekers, transforming these treasures into the lifeblood of their trade.
> 
> Expert alchemists, runewrights, and artificers within the Consortium refine the raw essence of Creature Cores, unlocking their latent potential. The Consortium's skilled artisans craft exquisite magic items, each infused with the essence of these cores. From enchanted swords to mystical amulets, their creations span the spectrum of wonder, blending ancient techniques with cutting-edge magic to ensure that every item resonates with power.
> 
> At the heart of the Consortium's headquarters lies the bustling Arcane Bazaar, a hive of activity where seekers and townsfolk alike peruse an array of wares. The Bazaar offers both newly crafted magic items and refurbished treasures, giving unwanted heirlooms new purpose. Here, seekers can find everything from enchanted weaponry to mystical trinkets, while townsfolk bring family heirlooms for appraisal, discovering hidden potentials within seemingly mundane items.
> 
> Key figures in the Exchange include Archmagus [[Elowen Stormweaver]], the enigmatic leader of the Consortium. Elowen's age is a mystery; some say she witnessed Aetheria's creation. Her silver eyes hold ancient knowledge, and her staff channels the very ley lines she seeks to stabilize. Master [[Thalric Stoneforge]], a Dwarven runewright extraordinaire, operates a forge that glows with the fire of a thousand suns. Thalric inscribes runes onto blades, shields, and armor, infusing them with the essence of Creature Cores. [[Lady Isolde Moonshadow]], an Elven alchemist with moon-kissed skin, creates potions and elixirs sought after by healers and seekers alike. She brews vitality tonics using various creature cores, granting resilience and swift recovery. [[Silas Emberwind]], a human artificer and master of clockwork constructs, designs mechanical golems that guard the Consortium's vaults. Silas fuses Creature Cores with ancient clockwork mechanisms, creating sentient guardians.
> 
> Seekers can bring their weapons and armor to the Consortium for Core Enhancement. A minotaur core might grant a blade unyielding strength, while a harpy core imbues boots with swift flight. The Consortium offers a bundle for novice seekers, including a basic weapon of choice, a healing potion, a temporary rune, and a backpack, encouraging them to "Forge your destiny."
> 
> Whispers persist that the Consortium's vaults hold a dormant Dungeon Seedâ€”an artifact of immense power. Only Archmagus Elowen knows the truth behind these rumors.
> 
> So, whether you seek a blade that sings with elemental fury or a trinket that wards off curses, step into the Arcane Exchange Consortium. Your destiny awaits, crafted from the essence of Aetheria itself.
