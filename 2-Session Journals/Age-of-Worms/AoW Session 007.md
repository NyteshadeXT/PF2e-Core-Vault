## During
### Events
After handling a Grick the players meet the ghost of Alastor Land.  He tasks them with burying his bones with those of his family on their land. The players try to negotiate to get what they want first, but Alastor is in no mood to deal with that. Upon getting to the Land farmstead they discover the bones of his family missing.  In the house they have a very tense encounter with a mother owlbear and her baby.  Under the mother they spy an intact arm with a distinctive tattoo which leads them back to Diamond Lake.  They meet Kullen at The Feral Dog and start to put the pieces together.
