# Adventure Synopsis
The bulk of the adventure involved the exploration of the Whispering Cairn, a sizable dungeon complex loaded with ancient traps and a collection of interesting (and territorial) inhabitants.  Deep within the complex, the PCs come across the ghost of Alastor Land, the runaway child who fell victim to one of the cairn's traps 30 years ago.  The undead horror blocks the PCs' progress, promising to Abandon the cairn if the characters return his bones to the small family cemetery on the farmstead just outside town.

This farmstead is now an overgrown ruin inhabited by a nasty owlbear.  The party's plans to return Alastor's bones are upset when they discover that the o0ther greaves in the family plot have been emptied.  To appease the ghost, the party must track down Alastor's relatives, no used as guardian skeletons by an unusual necromancer who has recently arrived in tow.  Correspondence discovered at the necromancer's home reveals that the villains are preparing for a coming event known as the Age of Worms.  The latter also refers to a secret cult hidden in a nearby mine, and implicates one of [[Diamond Lake|Diamond Lake's]] mine mangers in cult-related activity.

The PCs return to the Whispering Cairn, where the explore the ruins beyond the blocked door to discover an unplundered tomb protected by hostile creatures of elemental air.  At last, the PC's reach the tomb of the Wind Duke Zosiel and discover a treasure that may prove decisive in thwarting the advent of the Age of Worms.  The secrets behind this strange cache are revealed in the next installment of the Age of Worms Adventure Path.

# Part 1: A Face in Darkness
![[The Whispering Cairn-Enterence.webp]]

The yawning entrance to the Whispering Cairn lies about 10 minutes east of the abandoned mine office, a wide monolith-lined portal partially obscured by underbrush and boulders. Assuming the PCs have a general idea of where to look, discovering the entrance requires a DC 10 [[Perception]] check. Unless the PCs spend 10 minutes working to clear the brush and assorted debris from around the entarnce, treat the squares leading form the hillside to [[The Whispering Cairn#1. Cowards Rest|area 1]] as difficult terrain.

Unless otherwise noted, interior passages are 20 feet wide and 20 fee tall, with ceilings of smooth stone.

## 1. Cowards Rest
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Natural light dimly illuminates a long hallway extending north into darkness.  A faint breeze brings with it sibilant whispers that sound almost like sighing breath.  It must be a trick of the wind, bu tthe effect is almost lifelike.
> 
> The walls bear horizontal bands of deceptively simple geometric patterns at waist level.  In places the bands reveal startling detail, but in others the walls look as though they have been hacked apart with weapons or eroded by the rigors of time.  Flakes of ancient paint, brilliant purple and dull mustard hue, still cling to the walls in places, hinting at what must once have been a riot of color, A thin coat of dust coats the floor.
> 
> Just inside the darkened tomb, the hallway branches into shallow alcoves to the east and west.  Here the walls bear the most significant damage.  Dozens of clumsy etchings mar the beautiful ancient masonry like graffiti on a city wall.  A clump of soiled cloth about the size of a halfling rests in the rounded terminus of the western alcove.
> 
> Outside, the wind picks up, and a chorus of almost human sounds rises from the darkened hall.

In ancient days, the alcoves held great incense braziers mounted upon marble columns.  Looters plundered these priceless artifacts centuries ago, leaving only four small anchoring holes along the periphery of a circular depression an inch deep and 2 feet wide.

A fine layer of dust coats the halls first 60 feet.  A character trained in [[Skills#Survival|Survival]] can make a DC 14 [[Skills#survival|Survival]] check to notice that several wolves have crossed the dusty hallway numerous time in the recent past.

The western alcove contains a moldy old bedroll used by a local teenager daring to spend an evening in the cairn.  Any PC native to [[Diamond Lake]] under the age of 20 can make a DC 15 [[Skills#Society|Society]] check to remember childhood stories about a teenage girl who went missing 6 years ago.  Add a +1 bonus to the check for every year that the character is younger then 20.

The bedroll has hardened and become brittle with age, and cracks if examined too roughly.  It contains nothing of value.  A DC 15 [[Seek]] action turns up whittling shavings around the bedroll.

A DC 10 [[seek]] action by any character examining the patterned bands upon the walls reveals thin hollow tubes hidden within the pattern work.  The strange whispers filling the hall seem to emit from these holes.  The tubes extend to the surface of the mound above the cairn, where hundreds of tiny holes catch the wind and project it into the tomb.  The outdoor holes are well hidden (and many of them have been covered over and filled with debris), requiring a DC 20 [[seek]] action to discover them.

The patterned bands bisect the walls all the way to [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]], where more intricate frescoes replace them.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a DC 10 [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to notice a faint flickering green light coming from the north.  This DC decreases by 5 halfway down the passage, and the light becomes obvious by the time the PCs reach [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]].  The light comes from a guttering everburning torch in [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]].

> [!infobox]+
> # Campaign Seed: Wind Duke Glyphs
> As they explore the Whispering Cairn, the PCs encounter glyphs inscribed thousands of years ago by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa.  These are the personal symbols of the general Icosiol, the hero Zosiel and the architect Nadroc.  While the legend of the Rod of Seven Parts is common currency among bards and dreamers, few specific details regarding Wind Duke culture, history and writing remain.  Their personal glyphs are thought to be the original written form of Auran, before the language of elemental air came to be represented by Draconic letterforms thousands of years ago.
> 
> [[Translate]] and [[Decipher Writing]] reveal that the symbols are personal seals, and produce the name associated with each glyph (but not the significance of that name). Use the following chart to adjudicate any [[Bardic Lore]], [[Skills#Society|Society]] or [[Skills#ARCANA|Arcana]] checks regarding these glphys.
> 
> DC |  Information Known |
> ---|---|
> 10 | The glyphs don't seem to be formed from a common alphabet, although they are reminiscent of arcane symbols representing elemental air. |
> 15 | The glyphs represent names, with each referring to a single individual.  The glyph on the arcane apparatus at [[The Whispering Cairn#2. Transport Alcove|area 2]] probably represents the seal of the most important or highest-ranking of the three found in the Whispering Cairn.  The glyph on the sarcophagi is the lowest-ranking of the three. |
> 20 | The letterforms look similar to an ancient glyph-language called Vaati, which some unorthodox scholars consider the original written form of Auran. |
> 25 | Vaati is an Auran word meaning "Wind Duke," and refers to the legendary Wind Dukes of Aaqa who forged the Rod of Seven Parts.  A book called the Chronicle of Chan, falsely attributed to a princess of elemental air, records a full roster of the Wind Dukes present a the Battle of Pesh and a general record of what took place there.(Allustan can requisition the book from Ardentia City's Great Library in a week's time.) |

## 2. Transport Alcove 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The western hall extends perhaps forty feet, ending at a small marble platform raised about six inches off the floor.  A strange, shattered arcane apparatus rests upon this platform, its curved ovular frame giving the appearance of a noble's dressing mirror.  Only a third of this frame remains.  An unusual arcane glyph about the size of a man's head has been delicately carved into the baseplate of the support platform.

A DC 5 [[seek]] action turns up a few shards of an unidentifiable shiny black substance that feels like stone.  It is slightly cold to the touch.  Anyone inspecting the frame can make a DC 15 [[seek]] action to discover numerous runes and glyphs carved into a slot on the inside of the frame, where the "mirror's" glass would have been held.  These can be identified as arcane symbols signifying transportation with a successful DC 10 [[Skills#arcana|Arcana]] check.

In ancient days, a grand ring of portals connected several Wind Duke burial cairns, but now only two such portals still function, the one in [[The Whispering Cairn#3. Collapsed Passage|area 3]] and it's partner in the undisturbed cairn of Icosiol, the slain Wandering Duke whose grand tomb served as the main stop along the circle of black glass gates.  The base of the apparatus bears Icosiol's personal sigil, which has been all but forgotten by history.  See the Glyphs of the Wind Dukes sidebar for more information on how the PCs can learn more about the strange symbol.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The shards of glass might fetch as much as 5 gp from the right buyer.  In [[Diamond Lake]], that means the gnome jeweler [[Tidwoad]] or the magician [[Allustan]].

### Development
If the PCs make too much noise in this area, they may be detected by the wolves in [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]].  Each of the three wolves has a -2 modifier on it's [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check due to distance.  The DC for this check varies depending upon the PCs volume, ranging from 0 to 10.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check (DC 10) to notice a faint flickering green light coming from the north ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7G]]). 

## 3. Collapsed Passage 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Fifteen feet down the east passage, a huge pile of collapsed rubble blocks the alcove form top to bottom.  It looks like it would take weeks to tunnel through the densely packed debris.

There's a functioning portal beyond this collapsed passage, but there is no way for the PCs to reach it now.  This portal comes into play in a Future Age of Worms adventure.

### Development 
If the PCs make too much noise in this area, there is a chance the wolves in [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]] hear them.  Each of the three wolves has a -2 modifier on it's [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check due to distance.  The DC for this check varies depending upon the PCs' volume, ranging from 0 to 10.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a DC 10 [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to notice a faint flickering green light coming form the north ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7G]]).

## 4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The central hallway opens into a large chamber with wings leading to the east and west.  Across the chamber to the north yawns a twenty-foot-wide open arch draped from top to bottom in translucent cobwebs.  An eerie green light flickers from beyond the webs, casting strange shadows about this room.  The place smells of animal spoor and wet fur.
> 
> To the west, three short stairs lead to a wide marble dais, but the far end of the wing is obscured by darkness.
> 
> Huge slabs of cracked masonry and irregular piles of scattered debris choke the eastern wing, giving the appearance of complete collapse.
> 
> The sibilant, almost human whispers present in the passage become a chorus in this massive chamber, ,eerily echoing off the walls.

Anyone able to speak Auran gets the distinct impression that the whispers in this chamber are more than just a trick of wind and pipes. Occasionally, such folk can make out what must be words in the language of elemental air - words like "hopeless, sacrilege, enemies," and so on.  The words come form specially prepared air tubes leading to the surface, and are little more than a subtle way to discourage tomb robbery in a language few modern tomb robbers are likely to understand.

Thick cobwebs completely cover the arch leading to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]], blocking any view of that chamber beyond a flickering green light that seems to be a good distance to the north.  Characters standing within 5 feet of the cobwebs can see through the mess enough to notice that a short flight of stairs descends from the arch, but more detail than that is impossible to make out.  Dozens of tiny spiders dwell within these webs, but they are completely harmless.  Slashing through the webs is a full-round action.  A character can barrel his way through the mess but in doing so be becomes completely covered by spider webs to the point at which he can no longer see.  Clearing webs from the eyes of such a character requires a [[3-Rules/trait_reference/manipulate|manipulate]] action.

Even a casual inspection ([[Skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 8) reveals that the east wing is not as collapsed as it first appears.  A 10-foot-wide opening in the middle of the debris leads to the wolves den, [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den|area 5]].

```encounter
name: Whispering Cairn - Hall of Honor
party: Test Party
creatures:
  - 2: Weak Wolf
  - Wolf
```

### Tactics
The wolves prefer to gang up on the nearest opponent taking advantage of their pack attack ability and using knockdown to put an enemy on the ground as soon as possible.  They then savage the prone opponent until it stops moving, at which point they move on the the next target.  If presented with multiple targets, they tend to choose the smallest or weakest-looking foe.

## 5. Wolf Den
The wolves dwell in the nearly blocked-off terminus of the east wing.  Medium or larger characters must get down on their hands and knees to negotiate the rubble passage. 

![[Lantern.PNG|left]]
[[lantern.png|Show to Players]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The far side is rank with the smell of wild animals. Irregular piles of rubble litter the den, as do hundreds of bones and bone fragments from the creatures' past meals.  Most off these belong to animals, but a few are unmistakably human.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A DC 10 [[seek]] action in the northern half of the den turns up an old leather backpack half-buried under a pile of humanoid bones.  The bag contains an elaborate lantern of indigo metal inset with indigo glass panes.  The lantern is worth 12 gp.  A DC 15 [[seek]]j on the opposite side of the room turns up an intricately carved armband of unmistakable elven craftsmanship, bearing a repeating leaf motif.  The armband is worth 20 gp to a non-elf, and 25 gp to an elf NPC (such as the [[Diamond Lake]] mine manager [[Ellival Moonmeadow]] or one of his servitors).
> 
> A DC 20 [[seek]] action of the rubble mostly blocking off the passage turns up what appears to be a marble index finger cracked off a statue.  The finger exactly matches the right hand of the bas-relief sarcophagus lid figure in [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]].

## 6. Gallery of Seven Lanterns
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A wide dais spanning the back half of the western wing calls attention to a faded fresco upon the south, west and north walls. From a vantagepoint t the center of the dais, the wall painting makes it look like you stand within a massive room with seven short hallways radiating outward from a central point.  A chain dangles from the ceiling at the end of each hallway, and each chain bears a gleaming colored lantern.  Clockwise, the colors are red, orange, yellow, green blue, indigo and violet.

Through a bit faded the fresco is in remarkably good shape given its advanced age. Canny players will notice that the seven colored lanterns correspond to the seven colors of the rainbow, and that they are all lit.  This is a clue regarding how to bypass the face door in area 8.

## 7. False Tomb
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A wide stairway descends into an immense domed chamber. Seven short tunnels branch from the room in all directions, extending some thirty feet before ending in rounded walls. At the terminus of each passage, a thick chain dangles from an unseen high ceiling. Five of the chains bear colorful lanterns, but two hold nothing at all.  Opposite the entry stairs, a bright green lantern containing what looks like a torch casts a weird, murky light about the room.  Countless chips of glass and shiny metal inset into the chamber's doomed ceiling reflect this light, giving the impression of starlight and falling snow.  The dome starts about ten feet off the ground and reaches an apex about thirty feet over the center of the room.
> 
> Below the dome's peak, a long dais holds what appears to be a marble sarcophagus. A milky white bas-relief figure, perhaps of a human, rests passively upon the sarcophagus lid.  Unlike the rest of the tomb, this room is completely silent.

The sarcophagus in the center of the chamber might suggest that this is the final chamber in Zosiel's burial cairn.  It is in fact  a false tomb meant to discourage grave robbers, and contains a number of opportunities for such interlopers to meet an untimely end.  Arcane elevators hidden in the ends of the two branch passages lead to the quarters of the architect Nadroc and his team of servitors, who dwelled below for months while completing Zosiel's tomb. 

### The Sarcophagus 
![[Sarcophagus.png|right]]
[[Sarcophagus.png|show to players]]

At the center of the chamber is a raised platform, upon which sits a sealed sarcophagus.  The lid bears a white stone relief of a tall figure cloaked in a simple garment of allowing cloth.  It's difficult to say why, exactly, but the outfit conjures thoughts of ancient times.  The figure at first looks human, but a cursory examination reveals that it is about 7 feet tall, is completely hairless and is of indeterminate sex. It's arms and hands rest at its side.  The left hand curls upon itself in a fist, but the right is placed palm up, with the thumb turned in and all but the index finger held parallel to the arm.  The index finger, originally curled under the thumb (see illustration), was broken off by tomb raiders centuries ago and now rests amid the rubble in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den| area 5]]. The extended fingers represent a clue to the location of the true tomb.

The finger wears a scarab-like amulet around it's neck, inscribed with the personal symbol of Zosiel.  Like Icosiol's personal glyph in [[The Whispering Cairn#2. Transport Alcove|area 2]], this symbol has been all but forgotten in the modern age.  A DC 20 [[Skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[Skills#Occultism|Occultism]] check reveals only that is is a personal glyph of some powerful elemental entity.  See the Glyphs of the Wind Dukes sidebar for more information on how the PCs can learn more about the strange symbol.

The sarcophagus rests upon a small raised platform carved in the shape of a stylistic arrow, wit the tip aligned with the head of the relief figure upon the lid and a short "shaft" extending from the foot of the sarcophagus. A DC 15 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check is sufficient to shift the sarcophagus platform one "click" clockwise, until it comes to rest pointed at the next short tunnel extending from the central chamber. See the tunnel descriptions below for details on what happens when the arrow points at each tunnel.  The sarcophagus platform cannot be moved counter-clockwise.  When the PCs arrive, the arrow's tip points to the orange lantern ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7O]]).  The sarcophagus bears a fiery arcane trap set to trigger when the lid is lifted off the stone coffin, and is completely empty.

> [!danger]+ Sarcophagus Trap
> [[gout-of-flame-hb|Gout of Flame]]

### The Tunnels 
The ceiling of these tunnels is 10 feet off the ground, but the alcove ceilings at the ends of he tunnels extend 40 feet, just within the shadowy radiance of a torch.  Unusually colored lanterns hang from long chains attached to the alcove ceilings dangling about 5 feet from the floor.  The indigo and red lanterns are missing.  Each lantern is worth about 12 gp.

The lanterns are an elaborate key mechanism.  When torches have been placed inside all of the lanterns, the mouth of the howling face bas-relief in area 8 opens, revealing passage to Zosiel's true tomb.  When all seven lanterns have been lit, the glass and metal chips imbedded in the dome ceiling cast eerie reflections about the room, making it difficult to concentrate within the chamber.  All attack rolls made by anyone within the room when all lanterns have been lit suffer a -2 penalty due to the distracting effect.

As noted above, two lanterns are nowhere to be seen.  The indigo lantern rests in a backpack in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den]], while the red lantern is submerged in area 20 of the laborers' quarters.

A DC 10 [[Seek]] check at the end of each tunnel is sufficient to turn up a 5-foot-diameter circle carved into the floor, directly below the hanging lantern (or where a hanging lantern would be in the case of the red and indigo tunnels).  The circles form the tops of arcane elevators in the case of the yellow, green, and indigo tunnels and are merely decorative in the case of all other tunnels.

**Red:** The lantern that once hung from the chain at the end of this tunnel is nowhere to be seen.  In fact it was taken by a member of Ulavant's Seeker investigation 60 years ago and still rests with the thief's corpse in area 20.

**Orange:** An orange lantern hangs at the end of this passage.  The arrow platform at the center of the room points to this tunnel when the PCs arrive.

**Yellow:** A yellow lantern hangs from the chain at the end of this tunnel.  When the arrow platform at the center of the chamber points at this tunnel read the following to the players:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A great rumbling from below the chamber can be heard as the circular stone at the end of the tunnel rises eight feet into the air, pushed by by a 5-foot-diameter metal cylinder that seems to arise from the ground itself.  Seconds after it comes to a rest, tow thin doors slide into the sides of the cylinder, revealing a small empty chamber.

The cylinder is an arcane elevator that leads to the personal quarters of Nadroc, the Wind Duke architect who constructed Zosiel's tomb.  The cylinder fits only one Medium creature at a time (two Small creatures, four Tiny creatures, and so on).  A Large creature can cram itself into the cylinder, but can take only single actions while stuffed within the cramped space.

When a PC enters the cylinder, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The doors immediately slam closed, and the entire contraptions lowers itself into the floor.  The stone "cap" locks into place once it goes flush with the floor, but the rest of the apparatus continues downward, finally coming to rest.  The doors slide open quietly when the elevator comes to a stop.  

After traveling down for about a round the apparatus arrives in area 9.  One round after the passenger exits the cylinder, the doors close and the contraption rises on a column of air to return to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb]].  If the arrow platform above is moved to point to another tunnel while the cylinder is at rest in area 9, the elevator remains at the bottom of the shaft until the arrow once more points at the yellow tunnel.  A button inset into the wall near the bottom of the shaft calls the elevator down at any time.

**Green:** Several years ago, an explorer placed an everburning torch in the green lantern that hangs at the end of this tunnel, and it has remained here ever since.  Like the yellow passage, this tunnel boasts an arcane elevator that descends to another sub-dungeon, in this case the lair of the eight Wind Duke laborers who helped Nadroc build Zosiel's tomb.  Unlike the previous elevator, however, this one is jammed and is not likely to survive much experimentation.

When the arrow platform points at this tunnel,read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A cacophonous creaking of stone against stone emerges from the ground below the green lantern.  Anyone standing within the tunnel feels the ground rumble slightly, as if something is about to give way.

The elevator can handle only three more rounds of this stress.  On the third round of rumbling, the stone circle and the elevator apparatus beneath it completely give way, clattering to the ground of areas 15 60 feet below.  The collapse occurs on the third round in which the arrow points at the tunnel.  The three rounds need not be consecutive.  Characters standing on this area when it collapses can make a DC 12 Reflex save to scramble onto solid ground 

One round after the elevator falls, the PCs may make a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to hear the skittering of thousands of insects making their way up the shaft toward them.  The DC for this check is 5 for PCs in the green lantern tunnel and 10 for PCs in the main chamber of area 7.

Two rounds later, a living geyser of silverfish bursts from the shaft.  They make for the nearest PC, eagerly attempting to devour the character and move on to the next. Along with the [[Silverfish Swarm|swarms of silverfish]] emerges a [[giant silverfish]].  The silverfish swarms naturally seem to avoid the [[giant silverfish]].

The 60-foot shaft leading to area 15 is pitted and scarred, which makes climbing down relatively easy (DC 10 [[Skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check).

```encounter
name: Insects in the False Tomb
party: Test Party
creatures:
  - 1: Giant Silverfish
  - 2: Silverfish Swarm
```

**Blue:** The ceiling over the blue lantern is 50 feet high, unlike the other lantern shafts, which top out at 40 feet.  Anyone standing at the bottom of the shaft can make a DC 15 [[seek]] action to notice that the shaft ceiling is not visible in the radius of normal torchlight, unlike the ceilings of the other lantern alcoves.

A the top of the shaft, another passage leads to the northeast (area 8). To reach this passage, the PCs must devise a way to climb 40 feet.  The easiest way up is to climb the thick chain (DC15 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] Check).

A skeleton lies in a heap on the floor here.  A DC 15 [[Skills#Medicine|Medicien]] check reveals several crushed bones, as if the unlucky fellow died from a great fall.

**Indigo:** The chain at the end of this passage ends in a simple hook, as the indigo lantern was stolen years ago and eventually ended up in a backpack in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den]].  If the arrow platform points at this tunnel, a metal arcane elevator identical in appearance to the described in the yellow passage above rises from the floor under the dangling chain.  Characters inspecting the apparatus notice numerous crushed bones and moldy clothes upon the floor of the cylinder, an obvious clue that all is not as it should be with this arcane elevator.  Two rounds after a character stands within the cylinder the doors close and the contraption utterly crushes everything within it, sinking back into the ground until the arrow structure once more points at the indigo corridor.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> [[false-elevator-hb|False Elevator]]

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A careful [[Seek]] action through the crushed bones and moldy clothes DC 10 turns up a pouch containing 10 gp, 4 sp and a small ruby worth 12 gp.

**Violet:** A violet lantern hangs at the end of this passage.

### Ghosts in the Machine
Once each week, the minor wind spirits inhabiting the Whispering Cairn follow Nadroc's ancient instructions to reset certain elements of the tomb's design.  At this time, the sarcophagus in area 7 rotates counter-clockwise to once again point at the orange passage.  The elevators in areas 7Y and 7I rice and open, testing their lifting mechanism and the doors in a routine that lasts a full minute.  The elevator in area 7G heaves and shudders at this time, but does not rise.  The stress is enough to collapse the elevator, as outlined above.  Theoretically, if the party has not yet explored the Lair of the Laborers before the passage of three weeks, this collapse might open a new part of the dungeon for the PCs.

The spirits also reset the [[gout-of-flame-hb|Gout of Flame]] trap on the sarcophagus.  Once every year an powerful ancient sorcery replaces any of the colored lanterns that have been taken from the cairn, creating exact duplicates that hang from the correct chains.  Unfortunately, the poorly worded original incantation ensures replacements only for lanterns that have been taken from the cairn, meaning those lanterns that were taken from area 7 but that remain elsewhere in the cairn are not replaced.

If the party is completely flummoxed by this room, a fortuitously timed "refresh" of area 7 offers a blunt way to get the action moving again.

## 8. Passage of the Face
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A thin passage extends into shadows to the northeast.  Perhaps seventy feet away, the passage ends in what looks like an enormous stone human face, its mouth open in an angry scream.

The physiology of the face is identical to that of the near-human sexless figure depicted in bas-relif upon the sarcophagus in the room below.  The screaming visage dominates the entire 20 foot by 20 foot wall at the end of the corridor.  Anyone walking down the hall may take a DC 15 [[seek]] action.  If successful, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You notice several long scratch marks in the floor, as if something had been dragged toward the lip leading 40 feet down to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb]].  

These marks were left by victims blown away by the blasting winds of the trap, leftovers of futile attempts to slow their trajectory by jamming a dagger into the floor.

## Notes

> [!danger]+ Trap
> A pressure plate 60 feet down the passage triggers if more than 60 lbs. are placed upon it.  When this happens, the face animates, and a terrible wind erupts from its wailing mouth.  At the same time, the face's eyes spin with hypnotic illusory patterns in all of the colors of the rainbow that correspond with unlit lanterns in the chamber below.  Anyone within the face's gaze must make a DC 13 Will save or become paralyzed, frozen in place and unable to move.  Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt another saving throw to snap out of it.
> 
> The terrible wind is another major concern of anyone unlucky enough to be in the passage when the trap is sprung.  On the first round, the mouth blasts a strong wind, with the intensity ratcheting up one category every round, going from strong to severe to windstorm to hurricane.  Each round, creatures within the wind must make a scaling Fortitude save starting at DC 18 or be subject to the winds effects.  Small characters are potentially blown away as early as round 2, whereas Medium creatures face that risk on round 3.
> 
> Blown away characters are knocked prone and tumble `dice: 1d4*10`  1d4x10 fee, taking `dice: 1d4` 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.  Flying characters are blown back `dice: 2d6*10` 2d6x10 feet and take `dice: 2d6` 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.  Non-flying characters pushed over the edge of the shaft plummet to the floor below suffering `dice: 4d6` 4d6 points of damage upon impact.  Such characters may attempt to snatch the indigo lantern's chain with a successful DC 10 [[Skills#Acrobatics]] check or a DC 15 Reflex save, with success preventing the fall and the damage.
> 
> The wind continues at hurricane force for 10 minutes before it stops and the trap resets itself.  The only way through the face is to ignite torches in [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb]].  Once a torch has been lit, that color fails to appear in the face's hypnotic eyes.  When all torches have been lit, the trap is effectively disarmed.  The stone comprising the mouth's interior vanishes, allowing passage to the chamber beyond.

# Lair of the Architect
It took the Wind Duke architect Nadroc nearly a year of solid work to design and construct the Whispering Cairn.  During this period he dwelt within his work in progress, in a special series of chambers called the Lair of the Architect.  Due to the complexity of the elevator mechanism, this part of the cairn is not quite as looted as areas 1 - 7, and contains a number of treasures from Nadroc's time.  Ceilings in the Lair of the Architect reach a uniform height of 20 feet. Walls are made of solid stone.
