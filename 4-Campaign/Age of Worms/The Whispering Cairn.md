# Adventure Synopsis
The bulk of the adventure involved the exploration of the Whispering Cairn, a sizable dungeon complex loaded with ancient traps and a collection of interesting (and territorial) inhabitants.  Deep within the complex, the PCs come across the ghost of Alastor Land, the runaway child who fell victim to one of the cairn's traps 30 years ago.  The undead horror blocks the PCs' progress, promising to Abandon the cairn if the characters return his bones to the small family cemetery on the farmstead just outside town.

This farmstead is now an overgrown ruin inhabited by a nasty owlbear.  The party's plans to return Alastor's bones are upset when they discover that the o0ther greaves in the family plot have been emptied.  To appease the ghost, the party must track down Alastor's relatives, no used as guardian skeletons by an unusual necromancer who has recently arrived in tow.  Correspondence discovered at the necromancer's home reveals that the villains are preparing for a coming event known as the Age of Worms.  The latter also refers to a secret cult hidden in a nearby mine, and implicates one of [[Diamond Lake|Diamond Lake's]] mine mangers in cult-related activity.

The PCs return to the Whispering Cairn, where the explore the ruins beyond the blocked door to discover an unplundered tomb protected by hostile creatures of elemental air.  At last, the PC's reach the tomb of the Aetherial Warden Zosiel and discover a treasure that may prove decisive in thwarting the advent of the Age of Worms.

# Part 1: A Face in Darkness
![[The Whispering Cairn-Entrance.webp]]

The yawning entrance to the Whispering Cairn lies about 10 minutes east of the abandoned mine office, a wide monolith-lined portal partially obscured by underbrush and boulders. Assuming the PCs have a general idea of where to look, discovering the entrance requires a DC 10 [[Perception]] check. Unless the PCs spend 10 minutes working to clear the brush and assorted debris from around the entarnce, treat the squares leading form the hillside to [[The Whispering Cairn#1. Cowards Rest|area 1]] as difficult terrain.

Unless otherwise noted, interior passages are 20 feet wide and 20 fee tall, with ceilings of smooth stone.

## 1. Cowards Rest
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Natural light dimly illuminates a long hallway extending north into darkness.  A faint breeze brings with it sibilant whispers that sound almost like sighing breath.  It must be a trick of the wind, bu tthe effect is almost lifelike.
> 
> The walls bear horizontal bands of deceptively simple geometric patterns at waist level.  In places the bands reveal startling detail, but in others the walls look as though they have been hacked apart with weapons or eroded by the rigors of time.  Flakes of ancient paint, brilliant purple and dull mustard hue, still cling to the walls in places, hinting at what must once have been a riot of color, A thin coat of dust coats the floor.
> 
> Just inside the darkened tomb, the hallway branches into shallow alcoves to the east and west.  Here the walls bear the most significant damage.  Dozens of clumsy etchings mar the beautiful ancient masonry like graffiti on a city wall.  A clump of soiled cloth about the size of a halfling rests in the rounded terminus of the western alcove.
> 
> Outside, the wind picks up, and a chorus of almost human sounds rises from the darkened hall.

In ancient days, the alcoves held great incense braziers mounted upon marble columns.  Looters plundered these priceless artifacts centuries ago, leaving only four small anchoring holes along the periphery of a circular depression an inch deep and 2 feet wide.

A fine layer of dust coats the halls first 60 feet.  A character trained in [[Skills#Survival|Survival]] can make a DC 14 [[Skills#survival|Survival]] check to notice that several wolves have crossed the dusty hallway numerous time in the recent past.

The western alcove contains a moldy old bedroll used by a local teenager daring to spend an evening in the cairn.  Any PC native to [[Diamond Lake]] under the age of 20 can make a DC 15 [[Skills#Society|Society]] check to remember childhood stories about a teenage girl who went missing 6 years ago.  Add a +1 bonus to the check for every year that the character is younger then 20.

The bedroll has hardened and become brittle with age, and cracks if examined too roughly.  It contains nothing of value.  A DC 15 [[Seek]] action turns up whittling shavings around the bedroll.

A DC 10 [[seek]] action by any character examining the patterned bands upon the walls reveals thin hollow tubes hidden within the pattern work.  The strange whispers filling the hall seem to emit from these holes.  The tubes extend to the surface of the mound above the cairn, where hundreds of tiny holes catch the wind and project it into the tomb.  The outdoor holes are well hidden (and many of them have been covered over and filled with debris), requiring a DC 20 [[seek]] action to discover them.

The patterned bands bisect the walls all the way to [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]], where more intricate frescoes replace them.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a DC 10 [[Seek]] check to notice a faint flickering green light coming from the north.  This DC decreases by 5 halfway down the passage, and the light becomes obvious by the time the PCs reach [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]].  The light comes from a guttering everburning torch in [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]].

> # Campaign Seed: Aetherial Warden Glyphs
> As they explore the Whispering Cairn, the PCs encounter glyphs inscribed thousands of years ago by the Aetherial Wardens.  These are the personal symbols of the general Icosiol, the hero Zosiel and the architect Nadroc.  While the legend of the Rod of Seven Parts is common currency among bards and dreamers, few specific details regarding Aetherial Warden culture, history and writing remain.  Their personal glyphs are thought to be the original written form of Auran, before the language of elemental air came to be represented by Draconic letterforms thousands of years ago.
> 
> [[Translate]] and [[Decipher Writing]] reveal that the symbols are personal seals, and produce the name associated with each glyph (but not the significance of that name). Use the following chart to adjudicate any [[Bardic Lore]], [[Skills#Society|Society]] or [[Skills#ARCANA|Arcana]] checks regarding these glphys.
> 
> DC |  Information Known |
> ---|---|
> 10 | The glyphs don't seem to be formed from a common alphabet, although they are reminiscent of arcane symbols representing elemental air. |
> 15 | The glyphs represent names, with each referring to a single individual.  The glyph on the arcane apparatus at [[The Whispering Cairn#2. Transport Alcove|area 2]] probably represents the seal of the most important or highest-ranking of the three found in the Whispering Cairn.  The glyph on the sarcophagi is the lowest-ranking of the three. |
> 20 | The letterforms look similar to an ancient glyph-language called Vaati, which some unorthodox scholars consider the original written form of Auran. |
> 25 | Vaati is an Auran word meaning "Warden," and refers to the legendary Aetherial Wardens who forged the Rod of Seven Parts.  A book called the *Chronicle of Chan*, falsely attributed to a Warden, records a full roster of the Aetherial Wardens present a the Battle of Aetherion and a general record of what took place there. (Allustan can requisition the book from Ardentia City's Great Library in a week's time.) |

## 2. Transport Alcove 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The western hall extends perhaps forty feet, ending at a small marble platform raised about six inches off the floor.  A strange, shattered arcane apparatus rests upon this platform, its curved ovular frame giving the appearance of a noble's dressing mirror.  Only a third of this frame remains.  An unusual arcane glyph about the size of a man's head has been delicately carved into the baseplate of the support platform.

A DC 5 [[seek]] action turns up a few shards of an unidentifiable shiny black substance that feels like stone.  It is slightly cold to the touch.  Anyone inspecting the frame can make a DC 15 [[seek]] action to discover numerous runes and glyphs carved into a slot on the inside of the frame, where the "mirror's" glass would have been held.  These can be identified as arcane symbols signifying transportation with a successful DC 10 [[Skills#arcana|Arcana]] check.

In ancient days, a grand ring of portals connected several Aetherial Warden burial cairns, but now only two such portals still function, the one in [[The Whispering Cairn#3. Collapsed Passage|area 3]] and it's partner in the undisturbed cairn of Icosiol, the slain Warden whose grand tomb served as the main stop along the circle of black glass gates.  The base of the apparatus bears Icosiol's personal sigil, which has been all but forgotten by history.  See the Glyphs of the Aetherial Wardens sidebar for more information on how the PCs can learn more about the strange symbol.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The shards of glass might fetch as much as 5 gp from the right buyer.  In [[Diamond Lake]], that means the gnome jeweler [[Tidwoad]] or the magician [[Allustan]].

### Development
If the PCs make too much noise in this area, they may be detected by the wolves in [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]].  Each of the three wolves has a -2 modifier on it's [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check due to distance.  The DC for this check varies depending upon the PCs volume, ranging from 0 to 10.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check (DC 10) to notice a faint flickering green light coming from the north ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7G]]). 

## 3. Collapsed Passage 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Fifteen feet down the east passage, a huge pile of collapsed rubble blocks the alcove form top to bottom.  It looks like it would take weeks to tunnel through the densely packed debris.

There's a functioning portal beyond this collapsed passage, but there is no way for the PCs to reach it now.  This portal comes into play in a Future Age of Worms adventure.

### Development 
If the PCs make too much noise in this area, there is a chance the wolves in [[The Whispering Cairn#4. Hall of Honor (Moderate)|area 4]] hear them.  Each of the three wolves has a -2 modifier on it's [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check due to distance.  The DC for this check varies depending upon the PCs' volume, ranging from 0 to 10.

Every three rounds, allow the PCs a DC 10 [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to notice a faint flickering green light coming form the north ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7G]]).

## 4. Hall of Honor (Level 1)
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The central hallway opens into a large chamber with wings leading to the east and west.  Across the chamber to the north yawns a twenty-foot-wide open arch draped from top to bottom in translucent cobwebs.  An eerie green light flickers from beyond the webs, casting strange shadows about this room.  The place smells of animal spoor and wet fur.
> 
> To the west, three short stairs lead to a wide marble dais, but the far end of the wing is obscured by darkness.
> 
> Huge slabs of cracked masonry and irregular piles of scattered debris choke the eastern wing, giving the appearance of complete collapse.
> 
> The sibilant, almost human whispers present in the passage become a chorus in this massive chamber, ,eerily echoing off the walls.

Anyone able to speak Auran gets the distinct impression that the whispers in this chamber are more than just a trick of wind and pipes. Occasionally, such folk can make out what must be words in the language of elemental air - words like "hopeless, sacrilege, enemies," and so on.  The words come form specially prepared air tubes leading to the surface, and are little more than a subtle way to discourage tomb robbery in a language few modern tomb robbers are likely to understand.

Thick cobwebs completely cover the arch leading to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]], blocking any view of that chamber beyond a flickering green light that seems to be a good distance to the north.  Characters standing within 5 feet of the cobwebs can see through the mess enough to notice that a short flight of stairs descends from the arch, but more detail than that is impossible to make out.  Dozens of tiny spiders dwell within these webs, but they are completely harmless.  Slashing through the webs is a full-round action.  A character can barrel his way through the mess but in doing so be becomes completely covered by spider webs to the point at which he can no longer see.  Clearing webs from the eyes of such a character requires a [[3-Rules/trait_reference/manipulate|manipulate]] action.

Even a casual inspection ([[Skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 8) reveals that the east wing is not as collapsed as it first appears.  A 10-foot-wide opening in the middle of the debris leads to the wolves den, [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den|area 5]].

**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Moderate (80 XP) Level 1

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[Wolf, Weak]] W
 - 1: [[Wolf]] H

```encounter
name: Whispering Cairn - Hall of Honor
party: Age of Worms
creatures:
  - 2: Weak Wolf
  - Wolf
```

### Tactics
The wolves prefer to gang up on the nearest opponent taking advantage of their pack attack ability and using knockdown to put an enemy on the ground as soon as possible.  They then savage the prone opponent until it stops moving, at which point they move on the the next target.  If presented with multiple targets, they tend to choose the smallest or weakest-looking foe.

## 5. Wolf Den
The wolves dwell in the nearly blocked-off terminus of the east wing.  Medium or larger characters must get down on their hands and knees to negotiate the rubble passage. 

![[Lantern.webp|left]]
[[Lantern.webp|Show to Players]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The far side is rank with the smell of wild animals. Irregular piles of rubble litter the den, as do hundreds of bones and bone fragments from the creatures' past meals.  Most off these belong to animals, but a few are unmistakably human.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A DC 10 [[seek]] action in the northern half of the den turns up an old leather backpack half-buried under a pile of humanoid bones.  The bag contains an elaborate lantern of indigo metal inset with indigo glass panes.  The lantern is worth 12 gp.  A DC 15 [[seek]]j on the opposite side of the room turns up an intricately carved armband of unmistakable elven craftsmanship, bearing a repeating leaf motif.  The armband is worth 20 gp to a non-elf, and 25 gp to an elf NPC (such as the [[Diamond Lake]] mine manager [[Ellival Moonmeadow]] or one of his servitors).
> 
> A DC 20 [[seek]] action of the rubble mostly blocking off the passage turns up what appears to be a marble index finger cracked off a statue.  The finger exactly matches the right hand of the bas-relief sarcophagus lid figure in [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7]].

## 6. Gallery of Seven Lanterns
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A wide dais spanning the back half of the western wing calls attention to a faded fresco upon the south, west and north walls. From a vantagepoint t the center of the dais, the wall painting makes it look like you stand within a massive room with seven short hallways radiating outward from a central point.  A chain dangles from the ceiling at the end of each hallway, and each chain bears a gleaming colored lantern.  Clockwise, the colors are red, orange, yellow, green blue, indigo and violet.

Through a bit faded the fresco is in remarkably good shape given its advanced age. Canny players will notice that the seven colored lanterns correspond to the seven colors of the rainbow, and that they are all lit.  This is a clue regarding how to bypass the face door in area 8.

## 7. False Tomb
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A wide stairway descends into an immense domed chamber. Seven short tunnels branch from the room in all directions, extending some thirty feet before ending in rounded walls. At the terminus of each passage, a thick chain dangles from an unseen high ceiling. Five of the chains bear colorful lanterns, but two hold nothing at all.  Opposite the entry stairs, a bright green lantern containing what looks like a torch casts a weird, murky light about the room.  Countless chips of glass and shiny metal inset into the chamber's doomed ceiling reflect this light, giving the impression of starlight and falling snow.  The dome starts about ten feet off the ground and reaches an apex about thirty feet over the center of the room.
> 
> Below the dome's peak, a long dais holds what appears to be a marble sarcophagus. A milky white bas-relief figure, perhaps of a human, rests passively upon the sarcophagus lid.  Unlike the rest of the tomb, this room is completely silent.

The sarcophagus in the center of the chamber might suggest that this is the final chamber in Zosiel's burial cairn.  It is in fact  a false tomb meant to discourage grave robbers, and contains a number of opportunities for such interlopers to meet an untimely end.  Arcane elevators hidden in the ends of the two branch passages lead to the quarters of the architect Nadroc and his team of servitors, who dwelled below for months while completing Zosiel's tomb. 

### The Sarcophagus 
> [!caption|right wsmall] Floats to the right
> ![[Sarcophagus.png]]
> [[Sarcophagus.png|Show to Players]]

At the center of the chamber is a raised platform, upon which sits a sealed sarcophagus.  The lid bears a white stone relief of a tall figure cloaked in a simple garment of allowing cloth.  It's difficult to say why, exactly, but the outfit conjures thoughts of ancient times.  The figure at first looks human, but a cursory examination reveals that it is about 7 feet tall, is completely hairless and is of indeterminate sex. It's arms and hands rest at its side.  The left hand curls upon itself in a fist, but the right is placed palm up, with the thumb turned in and all but the index finger held parallel to the arm.  The index finger, originally curled under the thumb (see illustration), was broken off by tomb raiders centuries ago and now rests amid the rubble in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den| area 5]]. The extended fingers represent a clue to the location of the true tomb.

The finger wears a scarab-like amulet around it's neck, inscribed with the personal symbol of Zosiel.  Like Icosiol's personal glyph in [[The Whispering Cairn#2. Transport Alcove|area 2]], this symbol has been all but forgotten in the modern age.  A DC 20 [[Skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[Skills#Occultism|Occultism]] check reveals only that is is a personal glyph of some powerful elemental entity.  See the Glyphs of the Aetherial Wardens sidebar for more information on how the PCs can learn more about the strange symbol.

The sarcophagus rests upon a small raised platform carved in the shape of a stylistic arrow, wit the tip aligned with the head of the relief figure upon the lid and a short "shaft" extending from the foot of the sarcophagus. A DC 15 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check is sufficient to shift the sarcophagus platform one "click" clockwise, until it comes to rest pointed at the next short tunnel extending from the central chamber. See the tunnel descriptions below for details on what happens when the arrow points at each tunnel.  The sarcophagus platform cannot be moved counter-clockwise.  When the PCs arrive, the arrow's tip points to the orange lantern ([[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb|area 7O]]).  The sarcophagus bears a fiery arcane trap set to trigger when the lid is lifted off the stone coffin, and is completely empty.

> [!danger]+ Sarcophagus Trap
> [[Firespark Trap (1-2)]]
- [ ] Trap (4 XP)

### The Tunnels 
The ceiling of these tunnels is 10 feet off the ground, but the alcove ceilings at the ends of he tunnels extend 40 feet, just within the shadowy radiance of a torch.  Unusually colored lanterns hang from long chains attached to the alcove ceilings dangling about 5 feet from the floor.  The indigo and red lanterns are missing.  Each lantern is worth about 12 gp.

The lanterns are an elaborate key mechanism.  When torches have been placed inside all of the lanterns, the mouth of the howling face bas-relief in area 8 opens, revealing passage to Zosiel's true tomb.  When all seven lanterns have been lit, the glass and metal chips imbedded in the dome ceiling cast eerie reflections about the room, making it difficult to concentrate within the chamber.  All attack rolls made by anyone within the room when all lanterns have been lit suffer a -2 penalty due to the distracting effect.

As noted above, two lanterns are nowhere to be seen.  The indigo lantern rests in a backpack in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den]], while the red lantern is submerged in area 20 of the laborers' quarters.

A DC 10 [[Seek]] check at the end of each tunnel is sufficient to turn up a 5-foot-diameter circle carved into the floor, directly below the hanging lantern (or where a hanging lantern would be in the case of the red and indigo tunnels).  The circles form the tops of arcane elevators in the case of the yellow, green, and indigo tunnels and are merely decorative in the case of all other tunnels.

**Red:** The lantern that once hung from the chain at the end of this tunnel is nowhere to be seen.  In fact it was taken by a member of Ulavant's Seeker investigation 60 years ago and still rests with the thief's corpse in area 20.

**Orange:** An orange lantern hangs at the end of this passage.  The arrow platform at the center of the room points to this tunnel when the PCs arrive.

**Yellow:** A yellow lantern hangs from the chain at the end of this tunnel.  When the arrow platform at the center of the chamber points at this tunnel read the following to the players:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A great rumbling from below the chamber can be heard as the circular stone at the end of the tunnel rises eight feet into the air, pushed by by a 5-foot-diameter metal cylinder that seems to arise from the ground itself.  Seconds after it comes to a rest, tow thin doors slide into the sides of the cylinder, revealing a small empty chamber.

The cylinder is an arcane elevator that leads to the personal quarters of Nadroc, the Aetherial Warden architect who constructed Zosiel's tomb.  The cylinder fits only one Medium creature at a time (two Small creatures, four Tiny creatures, and so on).  A Large creature can cram itself into the cylinder, but can take only single actions while stuffed within the cramped space.

When a PC enters the cylinder, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The doors immediately slam closed, and the entire contraptions lowers itself into the floor.  The stone "cap" locks into place once it goes flush with the floor, but the rest of the apparatus continues downward, finally coming to rest.  The doors slide open quietly when the elevator comes to a stop.  

After traveling down for about a round the apparatus arrives in area 9.  One round after the passenger exits the cylinder, the doors close and the contraption rises on a column of air to return to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb]].  If the arrow platform above is moved to point to another tunnel while the cylinder is at rest in area 9, the elevator remains at the bottom of the shaft until the arrow once more points at the yellow tunnel.  A button inset into the wall near the bottom of the shaft calls the elevator down at any time.

**Green:** Several years ago, an explorer placed an everburning torch in the green lantern that hangs at the end of this tunnel, and it has remained here ever since.  Like the yellow passage, this tunnel boasts an arcane elevator that descends to another sub-dungeon, in this case the lair of the eight Aetherial Warden laborers who helped Nadroc build Zosiel's tomb.  Unlike the previous elevator, however, this one is jammed and is not likely to survive much experimentation.

When the arrow platform points at this tunnel,read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A cacophonous creaking of stone against stone emerges from the ground below the green lantern.  Anyone standing within the tunnel feels the ground rumble slightly, as if something is about to give way.

The elevator can handle only three more rounds of this stress.  On the third round of rumbling, the stone circle and the elevator apparatus beneath it completely give way, clattering to the ground of areas 15 60 feet below.  The collapse occurs on the third round in which the arrow points at the tunnel.  The three rounds need not be consecutive.  Characters standing on this area when it collapses can make a DC 12 Reflex save to scramble onto solid ground 

One round after the elevator falls, the PCs may make a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to hear the skittering of thousands of insects making their way up the shaft toward them.  The DC for this check is 5 for PCs in the green lantern tunnel and 10 for PCs in the main chamber of area 7.

Two rounds later, a living geyser of silverfish bursts from the shaft.  They make for the nearest PC, eagerly attempting to devour the character and move on to the next. Along with the [[Silverfish Swarm|swarms of silverfish]] emerges a [[giant silverfish]].  The silverfish swarms naturally seem to avoid the [[giant silverfish]].

The 60-foot shaft leading to area 15 is pitted and scarred, which makes climbing down relatively easy (DC 10 [[Skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check).

**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Low (70 XP) Level 1

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[Giant Silverfish]] W
 - 2: [[Silverfish Swarm]] H

```encounter
name: The Whispering Cairn - Insects in the False Tomb
party: Age of Worms
creatures:
  - 1: Giant Silverfish
  - 2: Silverfish Swarm
```

**Blue:** The ceiling over the blue lantern is 50 feet high, unlike the other lantern shafts, which top out at 40 feet.  Anyone standing at the bottom of the shaft can make a DC 15 [[seek]] action to notice that the shaft ceiling is not visible in the radius of normal torchlight, unlike the ceilings of the other lantern alcoves.

A the top of the shaft, another passage leads to the northeast (area 8). To reach this passage, the PCs must devise a way to climb 40 feet.  The easiest way up is to climb the thick chain (DC15 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] Check).

A skeleton lies in a heap on the floor here.  A DC 15 [[Skills#Medicine|Medicien]] check reveals several crushed bones, as if the unlucky fellow died from a great fall.

**Indigo:** The chain at the end of this passage ends in a simple hook, as the indigo lantern was stolen years ago and eventually ended up in a backpack in [[The Whispering Cairn#5. Wolf Den]].  If the arrow platform points at this tunnel, a metal arcane elevator identical in appearance to the described in the yellow passage above rises from the floor under the dangling chain.  Characters inspecting the apparatus notice numerous crushed bones and moldy clothes upon the floor of the cylinder, an obvious clue that all is not as it should be with this arcane elevator.  Two rounds after a character stands within the cylinder the doors close and the contraption utterly crushes everything within it, sinking back into the ground until the arrow structure once more points at the indigo corridor.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> [[false-elevator-hb|False Elevator]]
- [ ] Trap (4 XP)

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A careful [[Seek]] action through the crushed bones and moldy clothes DC 10 turns up a pouch containing 10 gp, 4 sp and a small ruby worth 12 gp.

**Violet:** A violet lantern hangs at the end of this passage.

### Ghosts in the Machine
Once each week, the minor wind spirits inhabiting the Whispering Cairn follow Nadroc's ancient instructions to reset certain elements of the tomb's design.  At this time, the sarcophagus in area 7 rotates counter-clockwise to once again point at the orange passage.  The elevators in areas 7Y and 7I rice and open, testing their lifting mechanism and the doors in a routine that lasts a full minute.  The elevator in area 7G heaves and shudders at this time, but does not rise.  The stress is enough to collapse the elevator, as outlined above.  Theoretically, if the party has not yet explored the Lair of the Laborers before the passage of three weeks, this collapse might open a new part of the dungeon for the PCs.

The spirits also reset the [[gout-of-flame-hb|Gout of Flame]] trap on the sarcophagus.  Once every year an powerful ancient sorcery replaces any of the colored lanterns that have been taken from the cairn, creating exact duplicates that hang from the correct chains.  Unfortunately, the poorly worded original incantation ensures replacements only for lanterns that have been taken from the cairn, meaning those lanterns that were taken from area 7 but that remain elsewhere in the cairn are not replaced.

If the party is completely flummoxed by this room, a fortuitously timed "refresh" of area 7 offers a blunt way to get the action moving again.

## 8. Passage of the Face
> [!caption|right ws-med] Floats to the right
> ![[Passage of the Face.webp]]
> [[Passage of the Face.webp|Show to Players]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A thin passage extends into shadows to the northeast.  Perhaps seventy feet away, the passage ends in what looks like an enormous stone human face, its mouth open in an angry scream.

The physiology of the face is identical to that of the near-human sexless figure depicted in bas-relif upon the sarcophagus in the room below.  The screaming visage dominates the entire 20 foot by 20 foot wall at the end of the corridor.  Anyone walking down the hall may take a DC 15 [[seek]] action.  If successful, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You notice several long scratch marks in the floor, as if something had been dragged toward the lip leading 40 feet down to [[The Whispering Cairn#7. False Tomb]].  

These marks were left by victims blown away by the blasting winds of the trap, leftovers of futile attempts to slow their trajectory by jamming a dagger into the floor.

## Notes

> [!danger]+ Trap
> A pressure plate 60 feet down the passage triggers if more than 60 lbs. are placed upon it.  When this happens, the face animates, and a terrible wind erupts from its wailing mouth.  At the same time, the face's eyes spin with hypnotic illusory patterns in all of the colors of the rainbow that correspond with unlit lanterns in the chamber below.  Anyone within the face's gaze must make a DC 13 Will save or become paralyzed, frozen in place and unable to move.  Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt another saving throw to snap out of it.
> 
> The terrible wind is another major concern of anyone unlucky enough to be in the passage when the trap is sprung.  On the first round, the mouth blasts a strong wind, with the intensity ratcheting up one category every round, going from strong to severe to windstorm to hurricane.  Each round, creatures within the wind must make a scaling Fortitude save starting at DC 18 or be subject to the winds effects.

Once a torch has been lit, that color fails to appear in the face's hypnotic eyes.  When all torches have been lit, the trap is effectively disarmed.  The stone comprising the mouth's interior vanishes, allowing passage to the chamber beyond.

# Lair of the Architect
It took the Aetherial Warden architect Nadroc nearly a year of solid work to design and construct the Whispering Cairn.  During this period he dwelt within his work in progress, in a special series of chambers called the Lair of the Architect.  Due to the complexity of the elevator mechanism, this part of the cairn is not quite as looted as areas 1 - 7, and contains a number of treasures from Nadroc's time.  Ceilings in the Lair of the Architect reach a uniform height of 20 feet. Walls are made of solid stone.

## 9. Architect's Foyer
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The walls here are covered in bas-relief images similar to the slender figure upon the sarcophagus lid in the chamber above.  Nearly a dozen androgynous, hairless humanoids stand in poses of deference, almost as if they are paying homage to the viewer.  Many extend their hands in adoration, their faces awash in adulation.  Several of the statues lack hands, arms, heads, or anything else easily hacked off by long absent tomb robbers.
> 
> About fifteen feet to the south, a dark passage extends from an elaborately carved arch.  Only a little of this hallway is visible, however, as a large stone block obscures most of the passage.

The stone block is roughly 10 feet wide by 2 feet deep by 8 feet tall, and nearly seals off the passage to the south.  A large niche about the same size as the block opens in the ceiling 10 feet above.  A fine layer of dust covers everything in the room.  A character crawling upon the top of the block gains a decent view of the darkened hallway beyond, and is able to make out a handful of alcoves marking the walls of the tunnel at regular intervals.  Squeezing between the tip of the arch and the top of the stone slab requires a DC 25 [[skill#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check.

A button inset into the wall near the elevator shaft serves as a call button for the elevator.  Pressing it recalls the elevator to this area.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> The stone slab is far too heavy to lift, but up to four characters working together can topple it to the north with a successful DC 25 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.  The slab rests upon a pressure plate set to trigger when the weight of the slab is removed.

## 10. Passage of Honor
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Curious carvings that seem to represent a stirring tempest cover the walls of this ten-foot-wide passage. At ten-foot intervals, small alcoves flank the passage, and each alcove contains an androgynous humanoid figure with cupped hands.  The figures stand roughly seven feet tall.  A faint wind seems to play within the passage, but it's difficult to tell where it's coming from.

Each statue bears the likeness of one of Nadroc's noble Aetherial Warden patrons.  Their cupped hands once cradled miniature statuettes of magnificent vaati buildings constructed by the architect in their names.  The figurines rested upon a soft current of air immediately above the statues' cupped hands.  These currents still exist, and will hold any Tiny or smaller object aloft indefinitely.  They are the source of the strange breeze in the hallway.  The statuettes now rest in the pouch of an ancient tomb robber who lies dead in area 11.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[lurking-stalker|Lurking Stalker]] W

```encounter
name: The Whispering Cairn - Passage of Honor
party:  Age of Worms
creatures:
  - 2: [Lurking Stalker]
```

A pair of gruesome aberrations known as a lurking strangler stalk within the shadows of one of the display alcoves. The stranglers entered the Whispering Cairn a week ago at the behest of their master, a wizard called the Faceless One who infiltrated Diamond Lake about a month ago.  This enigmatic figure ordered the creatures to explore the ancient tombs around the town, and it soon thereafter become trapped in the Architect's Lair after riding the elevator there during a routine test.

The lurking strangler is a 3-foot-long strand of striated muscle connected to two floating eyeblls. It stretches and twists as it floats through the air.

### Tactics
The lurking stranglers attempt to hide in the darkness until they can attack a character with a surprise sleep eye ray.

## 11. Gallery
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A dull gray stone pillar reaches from floor to ceiling in this large chamber.  Halls extend to the east and west.

The west wall of this room's gray central pillar holds a deep recession that ends at what looks like a fountain basin about 4 feet off the ground. This is the nutrient still, a magical apparatus capable of churning forth a nutritive orange sludge that looks a bit like vomit and tastes a bit like gravy.  One serving is sufficient to sustain a character for a full day.  Fifteen servings can be harvested from the basin when it is full (as it is now). Servings are replaced at a rate of one per day.

The area around the nutrient still is infested with [[brown-mold-gmg|Brown Mold]]. The extent of the mold infestation is displayed on the map.

The central pillar's east face bears a similar niche that extends from floor to ceiling.  IN ancient times, Nadroc hung his architect's tools on pegs in this alcove.  An unfortunate tomb robber later attempted to steal these tools, bringing a massive stone column down on his head.  A DC 15 [[seek]] check along the short wall north of the column reveals a hidden catch.  Triggering the catch hoists the column back into the ceiling, revealing a crushed human skeleton holding a shiny silver shortsword.  Most of Nadroc's tools were destroyed when the stone column fell, but one remains unharmed on its peg where the architect left it thousands of years ago.  Once the column has returned to the ceiling the trap is forever useless, as the trigger was destroyed when the column fell.

A dry fountain along the south face of the central pillar features a low basin and a snall spigot about 8 feet high, looking something like a shower.  The enslaved water elemental that once powered this apparatus died centuries ago.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The corpse in the tool closet holds a [[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1 Shortsword]], but almost all of his other possessions were crushed along with his bones.  In a leather sack so old that it crumbles to the touch can be found the remains of three broken statuettes of Nadroc's previous commissions (looted from [[#10. Passage of Honor]]) and three that remain in excellent condition - a grand palace, a slim spire with eight connected smaller towers of different heights, and what looks like a grand stadium.  Each intact statuette is worth 20 gp.  The intact tool is a [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/Phantasmal Minion|Wand of Phantasmal Minion]].

## 12. Living Quarters
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This wide chamber must once have been the living quarters of an important figure.  A large stone slab that suggests the shape of a bed rests against the east wall, under a huge bas-relief of a robust, long-nosed bald humanoid figure with outstretched hands.  The figure wears a lovingly sculpted wind-tossed robe that gives him the appearance of a triumphant god.  A glyph that looks like a stylized arrow marks an amulet worn around the figure's neck.  Wardrobes and dressers seemingly carved form the stone walls look to have been ransacked a long time ago.

This room was emptied of valuable centuries ago.  A thin bed of whirling air rests atop the stone slab against the east wall.  The wind is strong enough to suspend a medium character above the stone comfortably, making it an excellent bed. Anyone sharing a space with the bed must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming [[Fatigued]]. This effect ends when the PC is no longer in the bed's space.  The glyph on the amulet is Nadroc's personal symbol, and is reproduced as the compass rose of the map of this dungeon level.

## 13. Workshop
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ceiling of this large chamber glows with what looks like natural sunlight, illuminating a series of worktables, vises, spinning wheels, and blocks of unfinished marble that identify the room as a sculptor's workshop.  A huge unfinished statue of an imposing bare-chested warrior wielding a staff-like rod in its left hand dominates the north wall.  This hairless figure looks similar to the bas-relief on the sarcophagus upstairs, but is clearly meant to be a different person.  A short red metal pedestal against the south wall displays what appears to be a jet-black stone egg the size of a small boulder.  A gold glyph-an equilateral triangle with short hash marks though each leg-marks the face of the egg.

The statue is meant to represent the great Aetherial Warden who used the *Rod of Law* to defeat the Primordial Lord of Chaos.  The "rod" in the statue's hand is a petrified wood staff that Nadroc planned to replace later with a more ornate decoration.  Anyone examining the staff notices that six grooves have been cut along its shaft, suggesting seven segments.

The workshop has been completely looted, and all that remains are bits of furniture and parts of more elaborate sculpting tools.  The daylight coming from the ceiling is a permanent magical effect.

A successful DC 15 [[Skills#arcana|Arcana]] check identifies the gold symbol upon the ebon egg as the personal device of Ogremoch, a legendary elemental prince of evil.  A DC 20 result notes that Ogremoch and a legion of lesser earth elementals were said to have served on the side of the Primordial Lord of Chaos at the great final battle at Aetherion that ended a primordial war between Law and Chaos.

The egg is the dormant form of a hibernating small earth elemental who served at Ogremoch's side at the battle of Aetherion and who was later captured by the victorious Wardens and forced into a life of magical servitude.  The elemental, an evil lout called Artophanx, is forever bound to this chamber, compelled by ancient incantations to assist the Warden Nadroc, who constantly grilled him about the properties of indigenous rock or the likely efficacy of this or that masonic flourish.  The Lair of the Architect has been empty for thousands of years, so Artophanx went into hibernation centuries ago, and snaps out of his torpor only if touched. IF this happens, the elemental immediately takes on an anthropomorphic form and barks a challenge in Terran, the grating gravelly language of elemental earth.  IF the PCs do not respond, Artophanx attacks.

Artophanx wants more then anything else to escape, and might be fooled into cooperating with the party if successfully bluffed by a Terran-speaking character.  If convinced that the PCs might be able to help him escape the room (something actually well beyond their power) he can relate some useful facts about the Whispering Cairn's construction, including the fact that it was built by a Warden named Nadroc to honor a warrior named Zosiel who died no the fields of Aetherion and the fact that Zosiel's true tomb lies beyond the face in [[#8. Passage of the Face]].

## 14. Toilet
This austere toilet has not been used in centuries.

# Lair of the Laborers
Nadroc's creation of the Whispering Cairn required the assistance of eight skilled Warden laborers who dwelt in this sub-level.  They were several layer below Nadroc socially so the stonework and amenities of this level are markedly inferior to similar accoutrements in the Lair of the architect.  The ceilings on this level uniformly reach a height of 20 feet. Walls are worked stone.

![[Lair of the Laborers Map.webp]]

## 15. Laborer's Foyer
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Dozens of bas-relief figures similar to the one on the sarcophagus lid in the room above stare disapprovingly from the walls here.  Many sport crossed arms and stern expressions.  A few of the statues' heads are missing, and some have huge chucks torn out of them.  Others have a weird melted appearance, as if they'd been sprayed by something terrible.  A large glyph that looks like a stylized arrow points down a short corridor to the north that leads to a four-way intersection.

The damage to this room comes form the acid beetles in habiting [[#16. Food Room/The Hive]]. The alcove in the south wall conforms to the shaft leading to [[#7. False Tomb]] above.  The shaft starts 20 feet above the floor of this area and is pitted with acid-burned handholds ([[Skills#CLIMB `PF2 1`|Climb]] DC 12). The glyph-Nadroc's personal sign-is identical to the one found on the amulet in [[#12. Living Quarters]].

## 16. Food Room/The Hive

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The north and south walls of this large chamber taper in somewhat, and in the nook of the far eastern wall rests a wide stone basin backed by a five-foot-tall shelf.  A hardened orange paste spills out over the two-foot basin lip and covers much of the shelf.  Thousands of tiny beetles with bright blue carapaces skitter and tunnel through the chalky substance.  A keening insect chorus fills the room.  A huge organic mass completely fills the room's southwest corner.  Judging by the beetles spilling form within, it appears to be an enormous nest.

In ancient times, Nadroc's laborers sustained themselves on the nutritious substance generated by this fountain.  The orange substance is still edible, but those who eat it must make a DC 14 Fortitude save to resist becoming sickened for 1 hour due to the ubiquitous beetle waste.

The nest in the southwest corner has the consistency of papier-mâché, and can be cut through easily.  If burned, it produces an acrid black smoke that grants [[3-Rules/Effects/Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] to every creature in the room for 6 rounds or until the smoke is blown away.

**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Moderate (100 XP) Level 1

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map:

```encounter

creatures:
  - 1: [[Giant Bombardier Beetle]]
  - 1: [[Amoeba Swarm, Acid Beetle Swarm]]
```

This room serves as the central breeding ground of a colony of aggressive beetles who feed upon the edible orange sludge that fills the  basin.  

### Tactics
When the PCs enter the room, the vermin skittering about the sludge coalesces into the form of an acid beetle swarm, and a medium giant bombardier beetle, the cow of the colony, moves to attack, opening with a deadly spray of acid.  The insects fight to the death.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A DC 10 [[Seek]] check reveals the presence of three oblong lumps completely covered with orange sludge in the room's southeast corner.  These are the skeletonized remains of three long-dead human figures in soiled red leather armor. An eight-pointed star symbol markes the left breast of each moldy suit of armor, a symbol that marks the dead as followers of [[Kataklysmos]], which met a grim end in the Lair of the Laborers some 60 years ago.  One of the dead guards has three [[Healing Potion (Minor)]] and another wears some half-plate armor.

## 17. Sleeping Quarters
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Eight man-sized stone slabs, about four feet off the ground, are arranged in two rows in this large room.  A long-dead corpse, possibly a human, lays sprawled out upon one of these slaps, his read leather armor the only hint of color in the otherwise drab room.  The north and south walls taper in somewhat, and the short west wall abuts a small stone stage.  The red clay statue of a powerfully built warrior wielding a cylinder-headed greatclub stands tall upon the stage, its eyes surveying the room.

Each round characters within this room must make a DC 15 Will save to resist becoming [[Fatigued]].  The fatigue ends when the PC leaves the room.  The stone slabs once served as beds for Nadroc's Warden laborers.  The skull of the human male corpse on the southwest slab has been utterly crushed by the stone greatclub of the statue upon the western stage, a marble representation of the Guardian of the Veil, a mythical Warden figure who stands sentry between the lands of sleep and wakefulness.  The statue itself is not attached to the floor, and may be tipped over with a DC 20 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.  It weighs 800 lbs.

**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Moderate (120 XP) Level 1

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[Giant Bombardier Beetle]] W
 
```encounter

```

When the PCs first arrive, a pair of giant bombardier beetle stags stumble about between the sleeping slabs.  

### Tactics
The fatigued beetles do not respond to the sounds of conflict in area [[#16. Food Room/The Hive]], preferring instead to enjoy a rare moment of rest. They attack any non-beetle creature they sees, leading off with a spray of acid.

## Features of the Area
**Stone Slabs:** If any non-Warden falls asleep on one of the stone slabs, the terracotta statue on the stage in the western alcove animates and attempts to smash the sleeper with its club (treat as a slam attack, as the club is merely part of the statue).

**The Guardian of the Veil:** The guardian has 31 hit points and a hardness of 2. Its slam attack is +7 `dice: 1d20 +7` and does `dice: 1d8` 1d8 damage on a successful hit.

## 18. Tool Alcoves
Numerous pegs extending form the walls of these alcoves once held the excavation gear of the Warden laborers, but anything of worth was looted long ago.

## 19. Submerged Showers
IN ancient days, the laborers cleaned themselves and disposed of their waste in the lower level of their lair.  An enslaved water elemental commanded an elaborate set of showers and saw to the sanitary needs of the workers.  Centuries of isolation have driven this creature insane, and now the lower chambers and completely submerged in water.  Numerous drains near the shower pillars are wholly clogged with debris deposited by the elemental, leaving no way for the PCs to drain the area. The PCs first encounter the water about halfway down the stairs leading to this area.

All of the submerged rooms are completely dark.  PCs without darkvision must rely on some artificial means of light, such as the light spell or the everburning torch from [[#7. False Tomb]].

The four pillars and central structure of this room are composed of tan stone and contain non-functional shower spigots about 8 feet off the ground.

**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Trivial (0 XP) Level 2

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[water-elemental|Water Elemental]] W

```encounter

party: Age of Worms
creatures:
  - 1: [[Water Elemental]]
```

The insane water elemental still dwells here, spending much of its time spinning in a tight vortex in area 20.

### Tactics
It notices the PCs the second one of them touches the water, and swiftly moves to intercept them.  The elemental will try to attack any torch bearing character first. It has darkvision to 60 feet and would prefer to fight without a light.  IT waits until the torchbearer is in the middle of the area before attempting to quench the torch.

This chamber is home to the scholar Ulavant, who became a ghoul after his death at the hands of the water elemental prevented him from accomplishing his goal of cataloguing the Whispering Cairn's secrets for [[Kataklysmos]]. Ulavant wears a gold ring with the eight-pointed star insignia on the third finger of his left hand.

### Tactics
Ulavant attempts to paralyze his enemies, starting with what he assumes to be bards, wizards an sorcerers.  Though his mind is not utterly consumed with the need to consume, Ulavant maintains some measure of his brilliance.  He also retains a good measure of his original depravity.  Should he paralyze all of his victims, he moves the frozen bodies so that they can look into each others eyes before gorging on one of the victims, starting with the throat.  This theatrical flourish might just give one of the paralyzed PCs the chance he needs to shake free from the paralysis.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A ile of tattered clothes stuffed into one of the lockers hides a pouch containing 38 gp and 55 sp.  Ulavant's ring is worth 50 gp to the right buyer.

Areas 23-25 represent Zosiel's true tomb.  Very few explorers have penetrated as far as area 23 in the last several thousand years, and no living interloper has managed to negotiate the metal door at the end of that passage to gain the fabulous Chamber of Sighs. When the tomb was constructed, the door was meant to be opened only by the elemental thralls in area 24 at the behest of a Warden who spoke the correct long-forgotten phrase into the door.  An elemental would then press a catch on the wall opposite area 23, and the metal door would slide open gingerly.  Now, the only way through is to make a deal with the ghost of Alastor Land, a runaway who died exploring the Whispering Cairn nearly 30 years ago and who haunts the place still.

## 23. Alastor's Haunt
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Through the gaping mouth at the end of the hallway is a long, dark room with no floor. A three-foot-wide beam of petrified wood spans the cham, leading straight ahead into darkness. Amount ten feet below the beam, countless iron spheres the size of large oranges form an irregular floor, but it's impossible to tell if they represent a wholly solid surface. The northwest and southeast walls are covered in a honeycomb of geometric patterns. The featureless stone ceiling extends about twenty feet from the beam.

This room represents Nadroc's last attempt to dispense with unwanted tomb robbers, so the beam and walls combine to make a devious trap.  Note the side view of this room provided in the map of the True Tomb.

A curious grick lives in the iron spheres at the bottom of this room, having tunneled here through some subterranean fissure opened during an ancient earthquake.  Each round, PCs standing upon the spheres may make a DC 15 [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check to hear the grick moving under the iron spheres. If it hears the PCs, it rushes up to attack from surprise.

The grick is farm from the most potent potential enemy in this room, however, for the place is also the lair of Alastor Land, a young teen runaway who managed to slip through all of the Whispering Cairn's defenses 30 years ago only to die here. Now he lingers on as a ghost, cursed to forever remain in this chamber, wracked with guilt for having abandoned his mother and siblings.  As the PCs explore the room, Alastor observes from the Ethereal Plane. His childish giggles follow every PC mistake, while cries of "wow!" or "I thought you were dead that time!" seem to come from the walls as the PCs fight the grick.  Once they have defeated the aberration, Alastor decides that they are his best chance to escape the chamber and finally rest with his family.

![[Alastor Land.webp]]
[[Alastor Land.webp|Show to Players]]

Immediately after the fight ends, Alastor manifests, appearing as a translucent 13-year-old farm boy with a broken neck, long black fingernails, and a demoniac glare in his eyes.  He attempts to shield most of the PCs from his horrific appearance, but the youth has a flair for the dramatic and wants to make a powerful first impression, so he wants at least one of them to see him in his true from.  Thereafter, he attempts to move onto the same square as a PC and take over that character with his malevolence special attack. ONce he has controlled a PC (or if he cannot manage to do so), he speaks directly to the PCs.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> I have been here countless decades, punished for abandoning my family in a time of need.  Over these years, I have seen explorers like you come and go. The trap in the walls kills most of them, but others have left in humiliation, unable to pass through the far metal door. I am unable to leave the way you came because of my curse, but I am able to push through the far wall. Beyond is a glorious chamber of strange carvings and a pillar of air.  And there's a catch on the other side of the door that opens it without a problem.  I'll trigger it for you if you take my bones from here and bury them with my family on a farmstead just beyond Diamond Lake.  Do this for me, and I will be free.  I assure you there is no other way through that door.

Alastor left home 30 years ago. It's been at least a decade since the last adventurers came to this chamber.  They fell victim to the iron sphere trap, and their corpses are buried beneath the upper layer of iron balls forming the room's floor.  He an direct the PC's to his own skeleton, which lies about three feet below the surface just below the metal door.

```

If the PCs insist on fighting Alastor, he attempts to kill one of them to prove that he is a worthy opponent, thereafter pleading with them to take his bones back to his family plot.  His directions suggest a farmstead 10 minutes east of Diamond Lake. 

When Alastor Land's bones have been interred next to those of his family, the ghost immediately knows he is free from his curse and begins to fade from reality.  Before he does so, however, he passes through the northeast wall into area 24 and triggers the catch there.  The metal door slides open.

When the PCs return Alastor Land's bones to his family plot at the Land farmstead, award them experience as if they had defeated him in combat.

## 24. The Chamber of Sighs
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This cavernous chamber consists of a large stone walkway around a deep chasm that leads into darkness.  Four platforms lead from the walkway to a central ring, but two of these platforms are broken.  Bright light reminiscent of a summer's day filters down from the ceiling about forty feet above.  Four wide galleries extend from the outer walkway, their far walls covered with enormous bas-relief vistas.  A sighing wind emits from a huge pillar of rushing air at the center of the chamber.  The column extends from the floor to the ceiling, cutting through the room's central ring.

The central pit is 60 feet deep, ending in a featureless basin.  Each perimeter gallery bas-relief portrays a scene from the life of the Warden Zosiel.  The sculpting on the walls appears very crude from a distance.  Figures are blurred and distorted, and it's impossible to tell what the images are meant to represent.  When a character approaches within 10 feet of one of the bas-reliefs, however, valves breathe forth a smoky sheet of steam that covers the entire wall.  As the steam eddies and plays about the rough carvings, distance impressionistic images become apparent on the walls.  The images shift and move, making them come alive with action.

As soon as a PC reaches the walkway or central ring, two tall humanoid figures arise from within the column of air and step out onto the central ring.  Both of these creatures-wind warriors-who served in the armies at the Battle of Aetherion and who honor Zosiel still wield twin swords and wear ancient ceremonial armor festooned with red pennons that twist and bob as if always blown by a fierce wind.  The silent warriors attack intruders, knowing that they are the tomb's last defense.

> This image depicts a peaceful scene featuring several wardens relaxing in an idyllic country scene.  Dozens of perfect circles fill the sky above the frolicking figures.  As the steam runs over the image, dark, twisted shapes emerge from the sculpture's edges.  The shapes coalesce to form monstrous creatures that look like a cross between a spider and a wolf.  As the creatures approach the Wardens the circles in the sky begin to burst one by one.

This even represents the world prior to the war against the primal lord of chaos.  The circles in the sky represent cities protected by the [[The Aetherial Wardens|Wardens]].  Their destruction symbolizes the magnitude of the chaotic threat.

> This image depicts a towering Warden figure wearing the glyph of Icosiol standing over a legion of lesser Aetherial Warden warriors.  The central warrior bears the glyph of Zosiel, but each figure bears a glyph of a distinct Warden warrior named in the *Chronicle of Chan* (see Campaign Seed: Aetherial Warden Glyphs above). As the steam plays about the image, the warriors raise longswords in salute to Icosiol.

**24c**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A group of seven proud noble Wardens present a staff-like rod to a council of superior Wardens in this gallery image.  As the steam fills the bas-relief's contours the central figure raises the staff above his head, where it splits into several irregular parts.

Each of the seven Wardens presenters bears a carven glyph that identifies him as a member of the "Wandering Wardens" who abandoned the war against Chaos to discover the secrets of the Rad of Law.  The *Chronicle of Chan* identifies these beings as Amophar, Darbos, Emoniel, Icosiol, Penader, Qadeej and Uriel.

**24d**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The bas-relief in this gallery depicts the final battle between Law and Chaos.  As the steam moves about the image, the Wandering Warden Qadeej impales the Primordial Chaos Lord.  As the Chaos Lord, Rod and Qadeej vanish into a planar rift, Icosiol is struck by a beam from the Chaos Lords eyes and slumps dead to the ground.

The pillar of air here stretches from floor to ceiling.  Any character who steps into the wind is propelled safely to area 25. Doing so means getting past the rooms power defenders, however.
