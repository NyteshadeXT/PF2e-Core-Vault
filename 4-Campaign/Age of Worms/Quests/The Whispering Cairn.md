## Overview
### Summary
The players are tasked by [[Allustan]] to explore [[4-Campaign/Age of Worms/Quests/The Whispering Cairn|The Whispering Cairn]] and uncover it's secrets
### Storyline
Idle chatter around the village speaks of a trio of richly dressed adventurers who frequent the taproom of the [[The Feral Dog]], [[Diamond Lake]]'s most notorious tavern.  The confident heroes spoke of their intention to explore the long abandoned Stirgenest Cairn on the lake's distant shore.  The PCs, being natives of [[Diamond Lake]],know that cairn of oft explored by the community's youth, who always find it completely empty of marvels and perfectly harmless.

No so another cairn within a day's ride of the village.  This cairn lies near an iron mine that went dry.  The mine's charter lapsed when its manager died a few years later.  Situated in a sort of no-man's land, the cairn was all but forgotten, its yawning entrance overgrown with weeds and choked with debris.  Rediscovered by a curious teenager the cairn has since been a sort of community secret held by Diamond Lake's youth, who dare each other to disappear into it's cyclopean entrance to prove their bravery.  Occasionally, when the wind is just right, haunting, almost magical tones emerge form the depths of the forlorn tomb.

It stands to reason the the Whispering Cairn might also hold a genuine opportunity for profit.  the the rough-and-tumble mining village of [[Diamond Lake]], where desperate folk slave in dank tunnels to profit wealthy masters, an opportunity for profit is an opportunity to escape.

### Inciting Action
Local sage [[Allustan]] provides a deed for the [[Diamond Lake Mining Office]] to his apprentice [[Zamosshe]] and tasks the party with exploring the Whispering Cairn.
