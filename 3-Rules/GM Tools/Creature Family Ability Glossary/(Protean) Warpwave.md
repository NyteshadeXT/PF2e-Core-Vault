# (Protean) Warpwave

### 

**Category** offensive; 




Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.
