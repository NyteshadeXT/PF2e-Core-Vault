You are able to leverage your connections within the Society to raise funds for your allies' resurrection, ensuring that everyone lives to see another adventure. You and your allies treat your effective character levels as 1 lower for the purpose of the raise [[Spells/Raise Dead|dead spell]] and the [[Spells/Resurrect|resurrection]] ritual. This applies to both the level of the spell or ritual required, as well as to calculating the cost of the diamonds necessary to cast the spell or perform the ritual.
