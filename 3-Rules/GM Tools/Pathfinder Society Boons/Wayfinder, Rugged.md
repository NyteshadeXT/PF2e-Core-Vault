# Wayfinder, Rugged `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Item\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 2 with the Horizon Hunters; You own a [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]]

**Cost** 2 Fame

**Action** Single Action

* * *

**Effect** You have modified your [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] to absorb a small amount of your exhaustion, allowing you to continue exploring unhindered. When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] in your possession, granting you a special ability when the [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] is invested and in your possession.

As an action, you can reduce the severity of your [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened]] condition, reducing that condition's value by 1.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 Flat check. On a success, the [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] is broken. On a failure, the _wayfinder_ is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.
