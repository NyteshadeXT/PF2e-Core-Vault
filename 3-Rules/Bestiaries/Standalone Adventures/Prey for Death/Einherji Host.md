This volley fills a @Template[cone|distance:30]; all creatures in the area take 5d4+15 piercing damage (DC 36 Reflex check save).

    desc: "`pf2:3`  The einherji host Forms Up, Raises Shields, and prepares to counterattack. Until the start of the troop's next turn, each time an enemy takes an action to move through a space adjacent to the troop, they take 4d8+18 slashing damage (DC 36 Reflex check save)."

  - name: "Strike as One"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The einherji host makes melee attacks against each enemy within 5 feet (DC 36 Reflex check save).

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the einherji host Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares they may have as the result of having taken Hit Point damage), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."
