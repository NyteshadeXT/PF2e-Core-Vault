If the environment is not a viable environment for these plants, they wither after 24 hours."

A single leshy is a nuisance. A horde of leshies is a natural disaster. When confronted by existential threats or malicious ecological devastation, charismatic leshy leaders can rally their kin into a mob. These bands often include several kinds of leshy, creating a ragtag host that can communicate with and draw power from nearly any plant in its path. The farther they travel, the greater the mob's sense of cohesion becomes, gradually awakening an empathic hive mind, coordinated shapeshifting, and communal spellcasting far beyond what any individual could accomplish.

Leshy mobs rarely outlast whatever rallied them in the first place. After pillaging a lumber camp or liberating a greenhouse's contents, the leshies gradually shake off their mob mentalityâ€”often with some shock or sheepishness at recognizing whatever crimes they just committed. Though the leshies scatter, they often retain a faint sense of camaraderie with their old comrades, making it easier for them to gather again to confront future threats.

For all their cute appearances and harmless pretenses, leshies can become a formidable force when riled. What's more, leshies can grow larger, stronger, and more aggressive in regions rich in primal energy. The following presents several higher-level leshy threats that grow in primordial forests.
