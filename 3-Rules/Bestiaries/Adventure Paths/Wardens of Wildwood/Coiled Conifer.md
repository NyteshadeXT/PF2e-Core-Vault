This bent and slithering entity is barely identifiable as a tree. Tentacle-like roots extend from its trunk in odd places, meeting tumorous knots filled with caustic sap.

* * *

The Plane of Wood contains many unique ecosystems formed around species of wondrous trees; when Ayrzul's Blight mutates one of these trees rather than killing it, it can have a cascading effect on the tree's biome. Multiple species often mutate in tandem, becoming warped mockeries and a vector for Ayrzul's Blight. These "blight bonded" creature families are parasites and predators and typically form twisted symbiotic relationships.
