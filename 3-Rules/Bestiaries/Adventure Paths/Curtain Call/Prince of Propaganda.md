    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,divine,incapacitation,mental) **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Prince lifts the writer's quill he carries, points its nib at a target he can see that's within 120 feet, and then writes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] text in the air. The target hears the sound of the quill nib scratching words into parchment and must attempt a DC 44 Will check save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to Inscribe Propaganda for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target's worldview shifts, causing it to momentarily lose track of who its allies and enemies are. It becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The Prince's propaganda influences the target, causing it to believe lies about allies or foes and to take a course of action chosen by the Prince of Propaganda. The target is affected as if by subconscious suggestion, but with a duration of 1 hour, and the suggestion must arise logically from the target's temporary belief in the lie or conspiracy.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but with an unlimited duration."

  - name: "Prince's Curse"
    desc: " (curse,occult) A creature hit by the Prince's melee attack becomes cursed. It becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and takes 2d6 persistent bleed damage that's difficult to stanch. The DC to stop the bleeding using [[Actions/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]] is 40, and healing the creature to full HP doesn't automatically end the bleeding. Removing the curse ends the bleeding and off-guard condition."

  - name: "Shed Manacle"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The Prince has grappled a creature with his manacle\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The manacle clasps drop away from the chain the Prince holds. The creature remains grappled until they [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] (DC 44), at which point its manacles vanish. The Prince can't make manacle Strikes again until his next turn when his chain creates a new set of manacles at its end."

  - name: "Sneak Attack"
    desc: "  The Prince deals an additional 3d6 precision damage to [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creatures."

  - name: "Improved Grab"
    desc: "  The monster can use [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]] as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]."

Variant vilderavn

In their true form, a vilderavn is a great raven with a wingspan of 6â€“8 feet. Adaptable shapeshifters, they can change to the fighting forms of a snarling wolf, a hybrid of both wolf and raven, and a tall humanoid in black armor with a massive greatsword. More sinister is their ability to assume a humanoid guise suited to insinuating themselves into the retinues of boastful mortal rulers. With historical knowledge and clever rumormongering, they goad the proud into squabbles, feuds, and ultimately wars. The vilderavn stays at the ruler's side until victory is within grasp, the war almost won, then exacts the cruel stroke of betrayal. Their magic turns the mortals against each other, and the vilderavn's sword falls swiftly.
