    desc: "`pf2:2`  The mercenary squad members draw or reload their crossbows, then launch a ranged attack in the form of a volley. This volley is a @Template[burst|distance:10] within 80 feet that deals 2d6 piercing damage (DC 15 Reflex check save). When the mercenary squad is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a @Template[burst|distance:5]."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the city guards Stride, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20- foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the guards enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to all the guards.\n\nThe mercenary squad ignores difficult terrain (but not greater difficult terrain) caused by crowds or from movement through narrow spaces such as alleyways."
