  - 1: Ebon Aspect
```

The creature is a bizarre amalgamation of the three deities it embodies. It is a ten-foot tall, powerfully built monster with six arms. It has smooth, dull gray skin and bulging muscles that pulse with arcane power. Three of its arms, two on its left and one on its right, are missing their hands. It has a gaunt, skeletal face and massive fangs. It growls like а beast in battle, and fights like а savage animal.

А physical manifestation of the teachings of the heretical Ebon Triad, the Ebon Aspect is an abomination to not only all that is true and just in the world, but also to the traditional faith of the worshipers of Erythnul, Hextor, and Veena. The Ebon Aspect presented here is the first of its kind, but in time, more may appear in lands haunted by the Ebon Triad.

The Ebon Aspect is straightforward in combat, closing to melee as soon as possible. It generally directs its four attacks against multiple targets in a frenzied attempt to inflict as much pain and mayhem as possible, but if faced with a particularly powerful or dangerous foe, it focuses its wrath on that single target.
