abilities_mid:
  - name: Inflated Bulk
    desc: >
      When Tetranadon uses *Gorging Gulp*, it becomes [[enlarged]] and gains 20 temporary HP. While in this state, it gains a +2 status bonus to Fortitude saves, resistance 5 to all physical damage (except slashing), and its melee Strikes deal +2 damage. This lasts for 3 rounds or until it uses Belly Slam. Tetranadon can't be knocked [[prone]] while inflated.<br><br><blockquote>__Breakable__ **AC** 24; **HP** 25; **Effect** Located on the gut. When broken, Tetranadon immediately deflates, loses temporary HP from Inflated Bulk, and can't use *Gorging Gulp* for 1 minute.</blockquote>

  - name: Amphibious Charger
    desc: >
      Tetranadon can move through difficult terrain caused by mud, brush, or shallow water without penalty. Once per round, it can ignore the movement penalty from forced movement effects (e.g., shove, gust of wind).

abilities_bot:
  - name: Gorging Gulp ‚¨ª
    desc: >
      (arcane, transmutation) Tetranadon devours a massive quantity of earth and vegetation, becoming bloated with power. It gains the **Inflated Bulk** benefit. This action can be used once every 1d4 rounds.<br><br><blockquote>__Breakable__ See Inflated Bulk.</blockquote>

  - name: Belly Slam ‚¨∫
    desc: >
      **Requirements**: Tetranadon is currently inflated.  
      **Effect**: Tetranadon leaps up to 15 feet in a straight line and crashes down. All creatures in a 10-foot burst at the destination take 4d10+6 bludgeoning damage (DC 24 basic Reflex). On a failed save, creatures also fall prone. The area becomes difficult terrain.<br><br><blockquote>__Breakable__ See Inflated Bulk. This ability is disabled if the gut is broken.</blockquote>

  - name: Shell Shatter ‚¨ª
    desc: >
      Tetranadon slams its forelimbs together, sending rocky debris flying in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 25 Reflex save or take 3d6 slashing damage and become [[clumsy 1]] for 1 round.<br><br><blockquote>__Breakable__ **AC** 23; **HP** 20; **Effect** Located on forelimbs. Tetranadon cannot use *Shell Shatter* while the arms are broken and takes a ‚Äì2 penalty to Athletics checks to Grapple or Shove.</blockquote>
