Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni factions, carrying messages and negotiating deals between the notoriously independent groups. Although physically fragile, the dancers serve an important role within caligni society and are rarely seen without guards.

* * *

Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, with each caligni growing into a specific role and form determined by supernatural influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Many relish the chance to creep above ground at night to steal resources, shadow their surface counterparts, or simply make mischief.
