Leopards are among the smallest of the big cats, yet they are still dangerous creatures to tangle with. Leopard statistics can also be used for black panthers, white-spotted snow leopards, or tawny-coated cougars.

Few predators of the natural world can match the cat's talent for stalking and stealth. Large cats can be found in almost any environment, usually keeping their distance from settlements. When civilization encroaches onto a big cat's hunting grounds, the animals are often driven to making desperate attacks against unwary travelers.
