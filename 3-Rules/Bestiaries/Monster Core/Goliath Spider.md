    desc: "  The goliath spider has imprecise tremorsense to detect the vibrations of creatures touching its web.\n* * *\n\nTremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Goliath spiders dwell in the deepest jungles, where they build webs as big as temples and feast on prey as large as hippopotami.

Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.
