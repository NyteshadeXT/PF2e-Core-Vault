Powerful vrolikais command the untamed armies of demonkind, uniting them behind their one unifying desire for death and destruction. Unlike other demons, the dreaded vrolikai doesn't form directly from a single soul—they instead manifest when a demon devours so many damned souls that their own individual desires are lost in the sinful cacophony. A vrolikai who survives this process gains great power and can claim a region of the Outer Rifts as their own domain.

Vrolikais' enthusiastic embrace of the multitude of sins makes them uniquely suited to lead and unite demons, such that even demon lords often must rely on vrolikais to command their forces. The chaotic and conflicting motivations of demonkind leave little room to find common ground, but the vrolikai can expound upon the beauty of every kind of sin while marching demon armies to battle.

* * *

When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more "specialized" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.

Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.
