    desc: "`pf2:1` (primal,water) The mist stalker makes its mist cloud congeal, causing the aura to be difficult terrain until the start of the mist stalker's next turn.\n\nIn addition, the mist stalker can make the mist even thicker around a single Medium or smaller creature within the cloud.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The tentacled mist stalker shrouds itself in a cloak of mist through which its single, never-blinking eye can see with clarity, allowing it an advantage when stalking its prey.

Water elementals that become infused with cold or mist have increased mobility in regions outside of bodies of water.
