Hailing from the subterranean depths of the Plane of Shadow, sklaggans are scrawny, bipedal abominations with mouthless faces, wiry limbs, and spindly fingers tipped with dirt-encrusted claws. They invade other planes and use perverse organic technology to capture and conduct experiments on native inhabitants. To a sklaggan, every living creature is worthy of invasive—and thorough—examination.

The organic materials and weapons sklaggans employ are far from any natural substance familiar to dwellers of the Material Plane. Rather, these tools are as alien as the sklaggans themselves, consisting of disturbing biological parts such as writhing coils made of muscle tissue, slimy stones that visibly inhale and exhale from microscopic pores, and tentacular rods of spongy brain-like matter wrapped in slick black chitin.

One of a sklaggan's most popular implements is a throbbing, fist-sized siphoning device called a skagappa. When a sklaggan has selected a subject for experimentation, it notes the creature's sleeping patterns and hides a skagappa near the subject's bedside. Repeated exposure to this device, usually about a week, can leave a subject exhausted enough for easy capture, to say nothing of the psychic information intercepted by and stored within the skagappa. Sklaggans set up semi-mobile laboratories in remote parts of the region they are studying in order to conduct their gruesome experiments on abducted locals more quickly.

## Organic Shifters

Sklaggans shift from their subterranean laboratories to other planes and back via strange rituals that make use of their unique bio-technology. Non-sklaggan researchers' attempts to replicate these rituals always result in failure and, more often than not, nightmarish physical mutations.
