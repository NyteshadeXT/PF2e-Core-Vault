    desc: " (arcane,extradimensional) The bespoke bodyguard is an exceedingly efficient pack mule as well as an able brute and even jailer in case it must defend its master from assailants.\n\nEach bespoke bodyguard is constructed with a pair of extradimensional cavities built into its torso. Each cavity is equivalent to a _[[Equipment/Spacious Pouch (Type II)|Bag of Holding (Type II)]]_, with a capacity of 50 Bulk. The bodyguard can fit any Medium or smaller item into one of its extradimensional cavities as long as its capacity isn't exceeded.\n\nIf a bespoke bodyguard is destroyed, the contents of its extradimensional cavities are disgorged into adjacent free spaces."

On a critically failed save, the pushed creature also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,manipulate) **Requirements** The bespoke bodyguard has a Medium or smaller creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] and has an empty extradimensional cavity;\n\n**Effect** The bespoke bodyguard crams the creature into its unoccupied cavity. If the creature is unwilling, it can attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save. On a success, the creature avoids being stuffed into the bespoke bodyguard (on a critical success, the grab ends). On a failed save, the target is bundled into the bodyguard's extradimensional cavity for 2d4 rounds or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 29). Afterward, the creature is ejected into the nearest free space to the bespoke bodyguard. A willing creature can forego this save and remain in the cavity for up to 8 rounds, after which it is automatically ejected.\n\nThe bespoke bodyguard's extradimensional cavities are spacious and conducive to life, with plenty of air to breathe."

If a mechanical maître d's purpose is to provide entertainment and day-to-day assistance, then a bespoke bodyguard's purpose is to provide muscle and storage. Bespoke bodyguards follow their masters outside of the home and lend a helping hand whenever the need arises. A bespoke bodyguard's tasks include not just physical labor but also mortal protection. The mere sight of this iron-clad escort is often enough to deter would be muggers and highway bandits. When intimidation isn't enough, the bodyguard has a number of practical abilities to protect its liege from danger.

A bespoke bodyguard's torso features two extradimensional spaces. One of these spaces typically holds its master's luggage and useful items for traveling. The other space is left empty in case the bodyguard's master must seek quick sanctuary or the bodyguard needs to temporarily restrain an assailant. Bespoke bodyguards with more than two cavities are known, though the sheer cost of their parts (to say nothing of the complexity of their construction) makes them rare in the extreme.

## Muscle Over Mind

Compared to most constructed companions, the bespoke bodyguard is built of decidedly more solid materials, giving it a heftier frame and more raw weight behind its attacks. Furthermore, a bespoke bodyguard is programmed to perform far simpler tasks, meaning it is far less innovative or independent than either mechanical maître d' or automatic acolytes. This mindless obedience also ensures that the bodyguard isn't turned against its master by magic.

## Constructed Companion

The bespoke bodyguard is one member of a family of constructs that could be playfully described as synthetic servants, constructed companions, or artificial allies. All these constructs are designed by extremely skilled engineers, artificers, and spellcasters from a variety of disciplines for the purpose of entertaining, serving, and protecting their living masters and associates. Though each of these creatures has its own special abilities, associated creatures, and typical demesne, the mechanical maître d', automatic acolyte, and bespoke bodyguard all share the same basic feature of being highly complex—some might even say "intelligent"—non-living creatures made of metal and wood.
