Fortune tellers can predict weal or woe by reading the prophecies of cards drawn from a deck of cards called a divination deck. Faithful adherents of this long tradition maintain a deep and personal connection with their cards, which might be handmade or have been handed down across generations. Sometimes, especially powerful diviners might inadvertently infuse their deck with a sliver of their own soul. In such cases, what was an ordinary set of cards becomes a living divination deck.

These rare decks are not possessed of the personality of a single seer but rather have traits and quirks from each diviner who has wielded the cards and infused them with their spirit. Because of their close bond to the family or clan that created them, living divination decks are highly protective of their diviner and their diviner's kin. Barely sentient, living divination decks nevertheless possess some actual intellect, making them useful allies in various situations, even combat. Because it cannot speak, a living divination deck must communicate its thoughts by displaying cards in a specific order or way that conveys its meaning; such a vague mode of transmitting information, however, is rife for a comedy of misunderstanding.

## Divination Deck Familiars
