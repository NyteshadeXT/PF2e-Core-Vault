"Gymnophobia" is a cheeky nickname given to these strange aberrations, which appear to be roiling masses of dozens of gymnophiona—long, legless amphibians—conjoined to a single heart-like organ. This organ produces a blood-like substance that gives its constituent critters sentience and enables them to wear and preserve human corpses for weeks. Gymnophobias have a crippling fear of having their true forms seen by other creatures, and so they wear their macabre "disguises" to blend in with society. Of course, an outfit made from a bloated, hardened corpse does little to dispel most people's concerns at the sight of these shambling horrors.

Gymnophobias tend to dwell near graveyards, morgues, and battlefields for obvious reasons, though they are skittish and can easily be scared off to other feeding grounds. A sated, unthreatened gymnophobia is content to roll around in its rotting costume. However, many gymnophobias are quite vain, always on the lookout for new "garments" (flesh) or "fashion accessories" (body parts) to decorate themselves with.

## Multiple Personalities

While a gymnophobia's dozens of tendrils share a single mind controlled by the being's heart-like organ, each individual amphibian head has its own personality. If severed, a gymnophobia's head will grow back, but with a new personality. In this way, a gymnophobia self-polices, with the more violent or belligerent heads nipping off their weaker brethren. The only thing all heads seem to agree on is the need to hide and protect their monstrous heart.
