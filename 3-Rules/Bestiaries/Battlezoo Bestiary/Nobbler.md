Nobblers, sometimes called bag-people, are stealthy constructs designed to track and abduct unsuspecting quarry in the middle of the night. When inert, a nobbler appears to be nothing more than an empty sack made of leather, burlap, or hemp. While mobile, however, the creature takes a roughly humanoid shape, resembling a skulking kidnapper wearing a heavy cloak. A glance at the cloak's interior reveals nothing but yawning darkness.

Kidnappers send nobblers to track their targets in large towns, cities, and other densely populated areas where the nobbler can easily pass through unnoticed. Nobblers are almost always sent to collect targets and return them alive, making bag-people useful to duplicitous despots as well as run-of-the-mill ransomers. Enemies of the crown often find themselves on the wrong side of a nobbler so that one unscrupulous noble or another can exploit them with blackmail, imprisonment, or brainwashing.

Nobblers possess no intellect and frequently perform their orders to a frustratingly literal degree. When a nobbler is unable to locate its target, it might simply go inert until someone matching the target's description wanders by. As time goes on, the nobbler becomes frayed and its senses dull, expanding the scope of what it considers its quarry. It is not uncommon for adventurers and other interesting-looking folk to encounter confused nobblers in sewer gutters or alleyways.

Unlike a bag of holding, a nobbler expels its contents when destroyed. It may contain any number of valuables held by previous victimsâ€”and sometimes the victims themselves.

## Variant Nobblers

The easiest way to create a nobbler is to animate a bag of holding. In general, a nobbler's level is equal to 1 + the item level of the bag of holding from which it was created. The nobbler presented here was made from a bag of holding type I. Higher- level nobblers are not only stronger, but the capacity of their Swallow Whole ability is also increased in proportion to the type of bag of holding utilized.
