Each subsequent day a creature is in contact with the possessed crown, the wearer must make another Will save; the save's DC increases by 1 for each consecutive day the creature has touched the crown (to a maximum DC 34 after 10 days).\n\nThe coromn acts on its own initiative, giving orders and suggestions to the wearer of the crown as a free action. It cannot Strike while possessing a crown, but it can use its other spells and abilities. If the crown is destroyed, the coromn appears in the nearest empty space."

The allies can immediately perform up to a total of 3 actions (either one ally gains 2 actions and the other gains 1, or one ally gains all 3 actions), even if they have already acted this turn. These actions must be either Strike or Stride."

Coromns, also known as crown devils, rarely busy themselves with the machinations of Hell. Instead, these duplicitous fiends spend the majority of their time spreading corruption and dissent in the lands of mortals. Though in their natural form they are not as physically imposing or intimidating as many of their infernal kin, coromns wield the power to destroy entire nations thanks to their silver tongues. Their true power is not physical, but the ability to manipulate the malleable minds and easily bent morals of their mortal targets.

A coromn achieves its foul agenda by appearing as a beautiful crown, diadem, or other royal finery before an unsuspecting ruler. Upon donning the fiendish finery, this powerful sovereign-who may well have been a just and beneficent governer-becomes a puppet dictator subject to the crown devil's every whim. A crown devil's whispers can turn even the kindest of kings into hellish tyrants.

Perched atop the head of a brainwashed king, empress, or warlord, the full extent of a coromn's depredations is limited only by its own ambitions and the potential power of its pawn's post. Under a crown devil's command, a ruler might alter the destiny of an entire dynasty, country, or continent.

## Devil of Many Forms

Crown devils can inhabit virtually any type of headdress or formal headwear that denotes a status of royalty or authority. Some coromns have even been known to inhabit other royal garments such as royal rings, mantles, or scepters.
