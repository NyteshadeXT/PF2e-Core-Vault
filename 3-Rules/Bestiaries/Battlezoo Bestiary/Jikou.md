    desc: "`pf2:3` (concentrate,primal) A jikou can traverse the Material Plane by using a sleeping creature as a gate to and from the Dimension of Dreams. The jikou tears open a dream gate in an adjacent [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, dealing 2d4 + 13 slashing damage and 2d4 bleed damage to the creature. If this damage would cause the creature to wake up (typically because the creature is sleeping), it must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or remain asleep. As long as the creature is bleeding, it can attempt a new save each round at the beginning of its turn. Once a dream gate is open, it remains open for 10 minutes or until the creature's bleed damage ends.\n\nAny creature with the dream trait can enter or exit a dream gate to teleport across the Material Plane. To reemerge on the Material Plane, a jikou must tear open a dream gate while in the Dimension of Dreams, which it can do by targeting a sleeping creature's dreaming form. This has the same effect as opening a dream gate on the Material Plane, except the affected creature takes 2d4 persistent mental damage instead of bleed."

Despite their wit and strength, ankous—the most notorious assassins among the fey—can occasionally still be duped or trapped by a devious master's contract. Unwilling to be held captive by threats or obligations, a snared ankou's subconscious mind seeks a solution from within. The jikou is the answer to this dilemma—a phantasmagoric manifestation of the ankou's twisted, murderous dreams of revenge.

A jikou doesn't resemble much by itself—a tiny ball of shadows and flame that occasionally twists into the shape of a clawed fist. But every jikou carries with it a wicked razor of cold iron with which it enacts crimes and cruelty. The floating hand whips this razor about feverishly, its twists and turns becoming more erratic the closer a jikou gets to the blade's intended target.

A jikou's first target is nearly always the treacherous master to whom its ankou progenitor is bound to serve. An ankou might not even realize it has manifested a jikou until after the floating blade completes its mad mission. Afterward, the ankou and jikou tend to work in tandem rather than take on any more contracts. Together, these nightmarish fey are far deadlier than the sum of their parts.

## Dream Killers

Even when its ankou "parent" is bound by an iron-clad contract, a jikou can strike out and fulfill independent murderous schemes on behalf of its progenitor. A jikou travels across the Material Plane via the Dimension of Dreams, slashing portals through wandering dreamers like a phantasmal serial murderer.
