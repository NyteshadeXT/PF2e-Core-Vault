Feld hags, also known as harvest or lunar hags, kill and eat farmers, blight crops before the harvest, and kidnap mortal children to taint and raise as their own. The hag's unnatural essence twists such children into slavering monstrosities which serve the hag as guard beasts, hunters, and servants.

A feld hag stands a head taller than most of her hag kin, towering over just about anyone unfortunate enough to see her in her true form. When the moon is full, a feld hag looms ominously in the pale moonlight, with pitted sallow skin and a vague, twisted grin. As the moon waxes and wanes, a feld hag's skin shifts as well, always matching the lunar body's color-from porcelain white during a full moon to ebon black at the beginning of a new lunar cycle. When the moon glows orange or red in the autumn, the feld hag's flesh likewise glows with bloody intensity. No matter the moon's phase, a feld hag can be easily identified by her burning fingers, which grip an electrifying whip that obeys only that hag, and the foul-smelling igneous secretions that slowly drip from her every pore.

To covertly destroy crops and spread famine, feld hags transform into various nondescript animals like snakes, turtles, and frogs. However, even when a crop is destroyed, the feld hag's work is not yet done. A feld hag is rarely sated until she has feasted upon the raw flesh of a farmer's child or taken a brood to be pounded in her iron butter churn and fed to her dogs.

## Fear of the Birch

Although feld hags thoroughly enjoy tossing their hag tar, they take particular delight in administrating pain with their horrific birch whip. In the hands of a feld hag, a simple birch stick transforms into a magical whip of incredible cruelty and suffering. Although others have tried to take this whip from a fallen feld hag, once dropped, the whip instantly transforms back into a simple branch. Although the whip often bears a sickle at one end, feld hags use this as a tool in the field, not as a weapon.
