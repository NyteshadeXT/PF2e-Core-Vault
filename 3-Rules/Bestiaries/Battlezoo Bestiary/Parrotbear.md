Much debate surrounds the paradoxical specimen that is the parrotbear. Colorful and vibrant as a macaw but large and ferocious as a bear, the beast's closest approximation is the equally enigmatic owlbear. In fact, these creatures are so similar that it is largely thought that the parrotbear is the work of a copycat wizard who sought to put their own spin on the infamous strigine monster. Others speculate that the parrotbear may be some practical joke of the gods or simply an owlbear-adjacent evolutionary offshoot.

Regardless of its superficial similarities to the owlbear, the parrotbear boasts its own particular set of special skills and powers. Most notably, parrotbears can mimic voices, an ability they use to confound prey and predators alike, which gives them an outsize reputation for having a particularly wicked sense of humor, despite their clearly avian-level intellect. While parrotbears are arguably smarter than their owlbear kin, their ability to "speak" is not a sign of intelligence, and the nonsensical nature of their utterances becomes evident as one gets closer to the source of the babble.

Like owlbears, parrotbears are omnivores that favor meat whenever they can get it. A parrotbear's typical hunting tactics involve imitating the bark of a lost pet or the cries of a recently "disappeared" individual to lure loved ones into the parrotbear's jungle hunting grounds.

## Parrotbear Locations

Perhaps surprisingly, parrotbears are rarely found in the jungles south of the equator, where long-established apex predators easily outcompete them for food. Instead, they seem most prevalent among the outskirts of major metropolitan cities, where so many wizards' mad experiments often end up. Parrotbears even seem to get along with the owlbears who share their hunting territories; in fact, the two species' natural abilities compliment one another nicely, making such pairings especially dangerous.
