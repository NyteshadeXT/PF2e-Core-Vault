Skotogelias are wispy, wraith-like humanoids who originate from rare regions of the fey realm that somehow mix and mingle with the Shadow Plane. They are most often encountered in libraries, academies, and other places of higher learning, where they are understandably mistaken at first glance for violent ghosts or other spirits. To the contrary, skotogelias are peaceful and bookish researchers who are only too happy to help a fellow lover of knowledge or bibliophile.

Skotogelias eschew the capricious and oft-frivolous lifestyles of most of their fey brethren, instead single-mindedly focusing their efforts on researching and preserving lore about a particular area of study. They follow, examine, and catalog everything they can about their subject of choice. To organize and preserve their research, skotogelias maintain vast libraries in the fey realm using a magical umbral script scrawled in the shadows of the ever-shifting towering trees, rolling hills, and spinning lakes of their native plane. Of course, skotogelias recognize that not every creature is fluent in their incredibly complex written language. So they often make copies of their findings in more common tongues, then disperse such scrolls and tomes by leaving them in the nooks and crannies of libraries all over the Material Plane.

Skotogelias do realize that some knowledge is best kept under wraps or at least not freely dispersed. If a book or resource seems particularly dangerous, a skotogelia is apt to secret it somewhere on the fey realm, logging the forbidden lore's exact location only in the fortified lockbox of the skotogelia's own mind. Wily skotogelias have, however, been known to occasionally leave clues or tracks to such dangerous documents in places where a skilled and knowledgeable creature might be able to find them; such trails of clues are the skotogelia's "test" to determine if a being is worthy of bearing such powerful knowledge.

## Guardians of Lore

Though skotogelias are best known for their sheer studiousness and peaceful bookkeeping, there is no quicker way to rouse a skotogelia's ire than by threatening the library in which they dwell. If the safety of its research is compromised, a skotogelia will stop at little—risking life itself, if need be—to protect its domain.
