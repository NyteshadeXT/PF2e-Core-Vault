  - name: "Windsense (precise) 60 Feet"
    desc: "  A windborne dead can detect the movement of nearby creatures and objects from the tiny gusts of wind created by their movements. This is a precise sense at the listed range, but it works only against creatures and objects that moved through air in the previous round."

  - name: "Fear of Falling"
    desc: "  Windborne dead still carry within them the memory of their final fall and are terrified of being reminded of it. Once per hour when a windborne dead touches the ground, even if it took no damage from falling, it takes 5d6 mental damage."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) The windborne dead alters the winds around a plummeting creature, increasing the impact of their fall;\n\n**Trigger** A creature the windborne dead can see falls or descends in altitude;\n\n**Effect** The falling creature takes an additional 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it fell. If the creature was under an effect to protect it from harm while falling, such as _[[Spells/Gentle Landing|Feather Fall]]_, or if it was making a controlled descent under magical flight, the windborne dead can attempt to counteract the protection as part of using this ability (counteract level 5, counteract modifier +23)."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (air,divine,illusion,mental) The windborne dead imparts the debilitating sensation of vertigo and falling from a great height onto a creature within 60 feet.

  - name: "Hurl to the Winds"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (air,divine) The windborne dead summons powerful winds to whisk its foes into the air, flinging the victims to their doom. The windborne dead can choose to affect either a 5-foot burst originating from a point within 30 feet or a 15-foot cone originating from one corner of its own space. Creatures in the area must roll a DC 29 Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is flung 10 feet in a straight line in any direction of the windborne dead's choosing, including up into the air. If the creature collides with a solid surface or another creature, it takes damage as if it had fallen that distance.\n\n**Failure** As a success, but the creature is flung 30 feet.\n\n**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the creature windborne dead also automatically uses Accelerate Fall on the creature. The windborne dead doesn't need to spend a reaction to do this."

Power and creativity birth cruelty, and it is this combination that creates windborne dead. Sometimes cheekily referred to as "dropdeads," these beings arise from spellcasters who die from terrible falls from tremendous heights. Specifically, many windborne dead manifest from sorcerers or witches whose teleportation magic goes terribly awry, leaving them stranded high into the atmosphere, and the haughty spellcaster failed to prepare the most basic _[[Spells/Gentle Landing|Feather Fall]]_ spell as a contingency. Other times, windborne dead arise from powerful spellcasters who are simply and unceremoniously flung from the top of a rival wizard's tower.

In any case, the fear of their final moments, the pain of their deaths, and the lingering teleportation magic used to bring about their downfall causes these doomed mortals to rise again as spiteful undead. These twisted souls go about the world seeking only to inflict their fate unto others, particularly spellcasters.

## Windborne Spellcasters

Many windborne dead still bear fragments of the spell power they wielded in life, and such magically inclined dropdeads make powerful foes indeed. Evocation magic, especially spells with the air trait, are an obvious choice for windborne dead wizards, as are abjuration and illusion spells that can debilitate enemies and inflict mortal fear. However, regardless of its powers in life, a windborne dead can never cast _feather fall_â€”the spell which could have saved it from its horrible fate to begin with.
