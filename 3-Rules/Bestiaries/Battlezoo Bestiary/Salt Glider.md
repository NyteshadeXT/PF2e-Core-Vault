  - name: "Fluidsense (Imprecise) (1 mile)"
    desc: "  Salt stalkers can detect fluids up to a mile away, from large bodies of water to potions to even the blood in a prey animal's body. This is an imprecise sense, and salt stalkers cannot pick out smaller amounts of liquid within large amounts of liquid. For example, a salt stalker couldn't detect a creature hiding within a lake with fluidsense, only the lake."

    desc: "  A salt glider can sense minute changes in atmospheric pressure in order to accurately predict the weather for the next 24 hours."

  - name: "Water Vulnerability"
    desc: "  Water rapidly degrades the spines that cover a salt stalker. A salt stalker immersed in water, stuck in a rain storm, or otherwise soaked is Slowed 1.\nSpells or effects that temporarily drench a salt stalker, such as _Hydraulic Push_ or a bucket of water, cause the salt stalker to become slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds.\nAs long as it is slowed in this way, a salt stalker cannot make spines Strikes."

  - name: "Gliding Drop"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The salt glider Strides, grabs a willing Medium or smaller creature, then Flies up to its fly Speed while carrying its ally. At the end of this movement, the salt glider drops the creature onto the ground below.\nThe dropped creature takes 10 less damage than usual for a fall from that height. If the carried creature was a salt stalker and it lands adjacent to an enemy, it can spend a reaction to make a melee Strike against that creature.\nThe salt glider can grab an unwilling creature with this ability by succeeding at an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a failure, the salt glider fails to grab the creature, though it can still finish its movement."

  - name: "Desiccation Venom"
    desc: " (injury,poison) A salt stalker's teeth and spines inflict a terrible, toxic bile that violently dehydrates the target, making them more susceptible to heat.

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The salt glider is flying;\n**Effect** The salt glider whips its body about violently, flinging a volley of spines at enemies below. The salt glider makes three spines Strikes, each against a different target. Its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after it makes all three attacks."

Salt gliders loom high overhead in pale desert skies, acting as the far-seeing eyes of their salt stalker packs. Experienced desert travelers recognize a salt glider as the herald of an impending salt stalker attack. In most cases, the mere sight of a salt glider indicates that it may already be too late.

Whereas salt stalkers already have eerily thin, membranous hides, salt gliders take this attribute to its extreme. With their insectile wings, spindly legs, and bulging red eyes, one could be forgiven for mistaking a distant salt glider for an oversized mosquito or flying termite. Up close, however, a salt glider leaves little doubt as to its relation, however warped or monstrous, to its similarly alien salt stalker kin.

On land, salt gliders can roll up their wings into tight tubes and balance on them to walk about like grotesque stilts. Nevertheless, their long, clumsy torsos makes land-based movement difficult, so salt gliders almost always choose to fly. This same torso is light and flexible enough that salt gliders can whip their spines up to twice as far as other salt stalkersâ€”a tactic they make frequent use of as they harry their prey from above.

Salt gliders' usefulness toward their pack extends beyond just combat. Tiny filaments on their wings allow gliders to detect changes in weather patterns with incredible accuracy, and they relay this information to their kin with sharp, rasping barks. A salt glider flies for cover at the merest hint of encroaching rain or sandstorm. Canny desert wanderers who spot salt gliders on the retreat can reliably bet that foul weather is just over the horizon.

## Air Drops

In mixed hunting packs, salt gliders famously enjoy lifting and carrying their pack mates across the battlefield, though they can only do so for short distances. This ability dramatically enhances the maneuverability of all salt stalkers involved and enables the pack to conduct harrowing surprise attacks.

## Salt Stalker

Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.

Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.
