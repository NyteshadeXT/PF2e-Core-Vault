The first dredgenaut was supposed to be the last. It was made, so the legend goes, by a desperate community whose corrupt leadership had long denied its people justice for some ancient crime. The scavengers of the community collected scrap metal and trinkets of better times, then fused everything to create a construct that would uncover ample evidence of the ancient crime and force the leaders to acknowledge their atrocities. Yet, the leaders managed to steal the dredgenaut and use the powerful construct to track down its creators. The screams of these talented inventors could be heard for miles around. And so it was that the secrets of creating dredgenauts were revealed to all.

A dredgenaut is a powerful construct made of scrap metal and fueled by arcane toxic runoff. Powerful nations and private companies use dredgenauts to trawl for criminal evidence-either their enemies' or their own-in battlefields and ruined cities. To collect evidence, the dredgenaut picks up noteworthy items or creatures and drops them into the aperture on its face, "swallowing" them for later deposit. For reasons not entirely understood, dredgenauts are particularly prone to collecting supernatural or psychically resonant evidence that, when destroyed, can have dramatic aging effects on nearby living creatures.

## Desperate Measures

Though its primary objective is to gather evidence, sometimes a dredgenaut must temporarily forego this mission in order to ensure its own safety. By reconfiguring various internal gears and tubes, the dredgenaut can funnel collected evidence from its storage compartments into its engine core, causing the engine to overheat as magic items, trapped spirits, and other occult phenomena break down in the construct's body. The dredgenaut can then release this excess energy either via a "chrono beam" from its face or by venting the energy from its body in a sudden burst.
