Magically infused toys can provide a wonderful play partner for children throughout their early years. However, children outgrow their playthings and eventually discard old, worn, or musty toys—even magical ones. After enough time of neglect, the enchantments that control a wondrous toy begin to degrade or warp, and these once jovial dolls and baubles can morph into something sinister. Such a heinous phenomenon is compounded when a group of such twisted toys come together to form a toy swarm.

From animated toy soldiers to talking teddy bears, any toy that's been enchanted with magic can become part of a toy swarm. Although forgotten or discarded toys make up the majority of these amusive hoards, toy swarms can also comprise new toys. Such is sometimes the case when a group of children pester the local curmudgeonly wizard a few too many times and the wizard, fed up, transforms their toys and trinkets into a scuttling nightmare. Similarly, a toy chest accidentally exposed to a large quantity of enchantment or transmutation magic can similarly be transformed into a toy swarm.

Most toy swarms desire only to be reunited with their original playmates or find some other child to entertain, but the way they go about this can be frightening or dangerous indeed. A toy swarm on a mission to find a new playmate can rarely be deterred, and woe betide anyone who stands in the way of the swarm and its fun.

## Pacifying Toy Swarms

The easiest way to defeat a toy swarm is to agree to play with it. A toy swarm in the company of a bored child or a restless fey trickster is a happy swarm—at least for the moment.
