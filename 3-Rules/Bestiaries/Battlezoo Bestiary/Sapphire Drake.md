Sapphire drakes stalk mineral-rich caverns and volcanic islands all over the world, appearing in roughly the same locales as their namesake gemstones. With beautiful crystalline scales, broad blue wings, and ferocious tempers, sapphire drakes strike a surprising balance between beauty and brutality.

Even more so than most drakes, sapphires are extremely covetous of treasures such as gold, jewels, and pieces of art. Unfortunately for many would- be treasure hunters, sapphire drakes are also extremely good at hiding their wealth. These greedy dragons tend to quietly lair in remote places far from humanoid settlements, such as sea caves on distant islands, the lowest levels of gem-encrusted caverns, or the outer rims of scorching, sacrifice-laden volcanoes.

Sapphire drakes are also prone to enslaving smaller creatures, which they accomplish by playing on humanoids' predictable tendency toward greed. To acquire such servants, a sapphire drake will simply grant a humanoid supplicant a grandiose title, some chosen trinkets from its hoard, and command this new minion to dominate its fellows. While sapphire drakes are not particularly intelligent creatures, they understand their own weaknesses and value the knowledge and loyalty of their humanoid prizes. Sapphire drakes strongly detest falsehoods or illusions, and quickly eradicate any underlings they suspect of treachery.

## Drakes of Avarice

According to popular legends, sapphire drakes were originally created by greedy pirate-wizards who attempted to cross- breed jungle drakes and flame drakes. Their hope was to create a subservient species of drake to protect the pirates' treasure hoards and gem-filled mine shafts. The resulting sapphire drakes proved more than up to the task, quickly eradicating their former masters and claiming the bounty for themselves.
