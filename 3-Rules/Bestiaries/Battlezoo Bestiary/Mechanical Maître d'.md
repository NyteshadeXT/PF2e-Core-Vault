When it does so, the creature gains one of the following effects, which is chosen by the mechanical maître d' at the time of using Prepare and Serve.\n*   The eater regains 4d8 Hit Points.\n*   The eater gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks.\nEffect: Prepare and Serve - Combat Buff\n*   The eater can carry an additional 3 Bulk before becoming Encumbered, and its maximum carrying limit is increased by 6 Bulk.\n*   The eater gains a +10-foot status bonus to Speed.\nEffect: Prepare and Serve - Speed Bonus\nExcept for regaining Hit Points, each effect lasts for 1 hour. Once it has eaten a dish, a creature is immune to the mechanical maître d's magical food for 1 hour.\nA mechanical maître d' can store up to 12 servings of food and drink at a time. The mechanical maître d's torso compartment automatically casts _Enhance Victuals_ on any food placed inside."

A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or become Sickened 1 (Sickened 2 on a critical failure).\nThis cloud dissipates after 1 minute or once exposed to strong winds (such as from a _Gust of Wind_ spell)."

Part host, part squire, the mechanical maître d' is most often seen at the head of the house in luxurious restaurants or behind the bar at swanky drinking establishments. Wherever it resides, the maître d' dazzles and delights all who meet it, and it serves its master unerringly and with panache.

A mechanical maître d' is most often constructed in its creator's likeness, but a bit larger and with a stout torso designed to hold full dishes of food and glasses of wine and water. Seasoning herbs are kept in each individual finger, and the maître d' can extend its legs and arms to better reach eager patrons.

## A Dish Best Served Cold

Though primarily tasked with keeping order around a busy inn or bar, a mechanical maître d' is also responsible for the safety of its guests. If its clientele are threatened, a mechanical maître d' can wield cutlery normally reserved for food preparation to deadly effect. In even more dire cases, the construct can vent fetid gases from food waste stored in its body, nauseating enemies long enough for clients to get to safety.

## Constructed Companion

The mechanical maître d' is one member of a family of constructs that could be playfully described as synthetic servants, constructed companions, or artificial allies. All these constructs are designed by extremely skilled engineers, artificers, and spellcasters from a variety of disciplines for the purpose of entertaining, serving, and protecting their living masters and associates. Though each of these creatures has its own special abilities, associated creatures, and typical demesne, the mechanical maître d', automatic acolyte, and bespoke bodyguard all share the same basic feature of being highly complex—some might even say "intelligent"—non-living creatures made of metal and wood.
