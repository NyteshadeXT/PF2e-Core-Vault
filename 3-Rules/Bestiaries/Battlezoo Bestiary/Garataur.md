According to the legends of some warmongering gnoll communities, the emergence of a blood moon can herald the creation of a mighty warrior to lead the pack in its quest for slaughter—a bloodthirsty monster resembling a gnoll from the waist up, but with the body of a primordial hyena where its legs would be. This monster rapidly claims leadership of its clan through some combination of strength, charisma, and unparalleled bloodshed. In hushed whispers, as a new blood moon rises, the name of this beast floats on the lips of fearful gnolls huddled beneath their blankets—the garataur.

For remote gnoll societies that revere a demonic goddess, the coming of a garataur is often seen as a sacred and important event signaling the unholy favor of the queen of demons. Such zealous communities regard the creature as a representative of the goddess, and the gnolls' former leaders willingly step down to serve the divine emissary. However, for neighboring communities, gnoll or otherwise, the arrival of a garataur means little more than fear and pain for anyone caught in the monster's path.

Even the most aggressive groups of gnolls cannot compete with a war band led by a garataur, whose mind and body seem perfectly crafted for the sole purpose of slaughter. While violent gnoll communities might attack or enslave their neighbors when they are hungry or need more slaves, those groups led by a garataur actively seek out and instigate total wars. Such war bands attack until all their victims are dead or enslaved, fighting to the death. Once a fight has begun, a garataur never surrenders.

## Daughters of the Blood Moon

The most powerful garataurs possess divine powers and spells akin to those of a true cleric. These garataur priests are always female and refer to themselves as daughters of the blood moon. Indeed, their powers seem at their most potent during lunar eclipses, when they lead harrowing rituals beneath a red desert sky.
