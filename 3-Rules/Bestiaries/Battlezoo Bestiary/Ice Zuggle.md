These unassuming critters are a common sight on the elemental planes, where they crawl about in search of sustenance. Though their cute appearance is disarming and they are typically prey to the more powerful denizens of their home planes, zuggles still pose a threat to unwary or unprepared plane hoppers.

Dozens of varieties of zuggle existâ€”from common rock and fire zuggles to more exotic types like sirocco, mud, and brine zuggles. Nearly all zuggles share the same basic form, which resembles a large caterpillar or wood weevil made of elemental matter. Each zuggle has a central fin along its backside that expands to detect and absorb ambient elemental auras. Other than its fin, the body of a zuggle can vary greatly depending on what type of elemental aura it has recently absorbed. A zuggle on the Plane of Water might have fins and gills, whereas a zuggle on the Plane of Earth might have a rocky carapace and claws. Elsewhere in the multiverse, zuggles can be found trying to feed off of any elemental auras that they can get. In places suffused with all kinds of elemental magic, a zuggle might have a truly bizarre anatomy and might have any number of unique abilities.

While they aren't friendly by any means, zuggles are curious in a way that is often mistaken for an endearing disposition. It is not uncommon for a zuggle to follow around a spellcaster and sup up any spilled elemental byproducts from cast spells. A starving zuggle might display erratic behavior or aggression when it finally comes upon a source of elemental power. There have even been a few instances of a starving zuggle exploding after feasting too quickly on a potent elemental source.

## Zuggle Orbs

Zuggles naturally produce fist-sized globules of element-infused protein, which they store in specialized pouches that run the length of their spine near their fin. A zuggle can launch these globules at predators for self-defense, but alchemists and others prize these "zuggle orbs" for their unique magical properties and take care to extract them without scaring or hurting the zuggle.
