When the time is right, shale spitters lay clutches of pebble-like eggs in the walls of their burrows. Shale spitter clutches—also called shale swarms or "compactions"—tend to emerge from their eggs all at once. Newly hatched, shale spitters are less dangerous than common voles, and so they must rely on their compaction's sheer numbers for safety. Only a few shale spitters out of a hundred survive to adulthood.

Shale swarms are as adept at rooting through rock as scuttling atop it. The activity of so many little chomping mouths means that shale swarms leave trails of churned stone and rock dust behind them, much like woodlice leave trails of sawdust as they wind through tree trunks.

## Shale Swarm Avalanches

Unwary miners can run into trouble if they disturb hidden shale spitter burrows. To say nothing of the biting, clawing swarm of isopods as individual menaces, an upset shale swarm constitutes a deadly hazard to all around it when the compaction gets to tumbling down steep mountainsides and rocky gulches. Entire caravans, mining camps, and mountain villages have been reduced to rubble as a result of so-called shale swarm avalanches.

## Shale Spitter

Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselves—looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.
