Often likened to a hermit crab, the ferropaceon is a six-legged earth elemental with a naturally smooth magnetic shell upon which it single-mindedly hoards any magnetic materials it can find. Though they hail from the Elemental Plane of Earth and tend to emerge on the Material Plane within the cavernous depths of ore-rich mountains, ferropaceons inevitably wander toward humanoid lands in search of ever more and ever rarer metal objects. Junkyards, old battlefields, and the outskirts of highly industrial cities have all known a ferropaceon at one time or another.

## Ferropaceon Weapons

Though not malicious, ferropaceons are highly territorial, viewing any object magnetically stuck to their body as rightly theirs. Most ferropaceons defend their treasures with scissor-like claws that can slice through flesh and bone with ease. The oldest ferropaceons can control their magnetic fields to such a degree that they can "wield" metallic weapons like swords and hammers, oscillating their magnetism so that the weapon hovers around them and strikes at their command.
