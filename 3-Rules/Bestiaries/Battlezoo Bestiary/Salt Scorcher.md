  - name: "Fluidsense (Imprecise) (1 mile)"
    desc: "  Salt stalkers can detect fluids up to a mile away, from large bodies of water to potions to even the blood in a prey animal's body. This is an imprecise sense, and salt stalkers cannot pick out smaller amounts of liquid within large amounts of liquid. For example, a salt stalker couldn't detect a creature hiding within a lake with fluidsense, only the lake."

  - name: "Hot Water"
    desc: "  A salt scorcher's fiery grease explodes violently on contact with water. This is typically triggered in one of two ways: either the salt scorcher targets a creature that is already drenched or standing in water, or a creature covered in fiery grease attempts to douse the flames with water. In the latter case, if the creature was dousing itself to roll a flat check to end the persistent fire damage, it automatically fails this check.\n\nWhen either of these triggers occurs, the fiery grease covering a creature explodes, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature in a 15-foot burst, including the creature covered in the grease (DC 21 basic Reflex save). The fiery grease covering a creature can explode up to once per round."

  - name: "Spew Fiery Grease"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (fire,primal) The salt scorcher spits a thick, steamy, 30-foot line of smoldering, highly flammable grease. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or be covered in the sticky, hot grease, which deals 1d6 persistent fire damage and explodes on contact with water (see Hot Water).\n\nThe salt scorcher can't Spew Fiery Grease again for 1d4 rounds."

Salt scorchers are a fire-spitting off-shoot of the typical salt stalker. Slightly shorter and much stockier than their kin, salt scorchers frequently lead salt stalker hunting parties, if only because, in addition to possessing fiery tempers, they are natural-born bullies. Salt scorchers rarely band together with other salt scorchers since they often let their pride get the better of them.

The viscous grease that salt scorchers spray from their mouths is no mere spittle; the caustic sputum eats through living and non-living matter much like acid, though it is plain to all who experience it that the potent goo courses with flame, pure and simple. Worse, this greasy mixture reacts violently with water, making a bad situation worse for anyone unfortunate enough to try and douse the grease with a canteen or, gods forbid, jumping into a pond.

Hunting packs led by salt scorchers toe a precarious line. All salt stalkers, scorchers included, are dramatically weakened by water, yet salt scorchers' caustic grease often causes its prey to seek out exactly that. If a burning victim were to fling a wineskin full of water at the salt stalkers rather than attempt to douse its own grease fire, that creature would be much better off, and the salt stalkers weakened. Luckily for the salt stalkers, most prey don't figure this out before succumbing to their wounds.

## Salty Runoff

The salty bile that seeps from a nest of salt stalkers can quickly render nearby still or slow-flowing water sources undrinkable. An adventurer's first clue that something might not be right in this desert is an oasis full of saltwater.

## Salt Stalker

Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.

Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.
