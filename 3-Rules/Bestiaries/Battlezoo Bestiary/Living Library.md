When a powerful wizard loses or abandons their spellbook, the book can retain a portion of their owner's magical energy, gaining sentience in the process. Alone, these sentient books pose little danger, but in old wizarding schools or vast personal libraries, large numbers of such lost books can find one another and magically bond into a walking repository of arcane knowledge with a mind of its ownâ€”a creature called a living library.

Living libraries tend to wander the world, searching for lost knowledge and rare books to add to their collection and increase the repertoire of spells at their disposal. Though they typically "read" by subsuming scrolls, tomes, and tablets into their form, living libraries can also learn new types of magic just by watching spellcasters. Suffused as they are with such massive stores of arcane power, it's no surprise that living libraries can cause spells to fizzle or falter before they ever reach their target.

## Living Library Forms

Most living libraries tend to assume a humanoid figure that resembles the size and shape of their original owners, but no two libraries are the same, and some might just as well walk about in the form of a four-legged mammal or six-legged insect. The most ancient living libraries are massive and alien looking, shuffling across the cosmos as serpentine or globular assemblages that defy mortal description.
