Chamber oozes are viscous, algae-like creatures that coat the walls and fixtures of entire dungeon rooms, then engulf living creatures who wander into the seemingly mundane chamber.

To accomplish their namesake feat, chamber oozes fill themselves with air and expand dramatically, stretching to the point that their orange color is discernible only as a wet sheen or moldy film over the dungeon's surfaces. Most adventurers take unpleasant grime as a given in the sodden crypts and ruins they frequent and so pay no heed to rooms that appear to be dripping with rank mildew. Such precariousness has led to many spelunkers' demise as they simply walk unknowingly into a chamber ooze's stretched-out stomach. The ooze then snaps in on itself, smashing its victims with ooze-wrapped furniture before engulfing its unsuspecting prey.

To ensure prey wanders into its trap, a chamber ooze must perfectly align its two orifices with the room's most likely points of entry, such as a doorway, a trapdoor, or a chute in the ceiling. However, because they cannot see use logic in any real sense, chamber oozes sometimes slightly (or totally) miscalculate the entryways. In this way, a chamber ooze might spoil its own ruse by positioning its mouths around obviously obstructed openings like false doors or collapsed tunnels. At other times, a chamber ooze can inadvertently reveal the existence of hidden doorways or the true nature of illusory walls, such as by leaving a suspiciously door-shaped gap in the orange fungus that otherwise coats a room's walls.

## Allies of Convenience

Though mindless, chamber oozes sometimes exhibit uncanny deference to certain other dungeon denizens, most notably mimics. The ooze allows the mimic to dwell within its space, then the two fight in tandem to create a perilous encounter for treasure hunters. Of course, sometimes a chamber ooze might get carried away and consume its weakened mimic friend as well. The smartest mimic partners make sure to have a clear path to the room's exit at all times.
