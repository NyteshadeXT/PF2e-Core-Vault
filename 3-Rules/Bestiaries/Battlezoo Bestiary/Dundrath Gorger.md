Dundraths are thickset humanoids who resemble woolly mammoths except for their burly arms and hands and keen yellow eyes. In the icy wildernesses and tundra plains where they roam, dundraths wear no leathers or clothing-only their thick, wiry coats insulate them from the bitterest elements. All the same, their razor-sharp tusks and pierced trunks strike an imposing image, and few northern wanderers willfully engage with even a solitary dundrath hunter.

Dundraths have little love for art, culture, or even companionship. A dundrath's primary motivation is simple: find and devour a warm-blooded meal. More than mere hunger, this ravenous drive compels dundraths to attack mercilessly and indiscriminately, even when up against creatures significantly larger or stronger than themselves. Perhaps because of their insatiable lust for food, dundraths almost invariably delight in the hunt, and many take grotesque pleasure in the pain and anguish they inflict on living creatures. However, a dundrath doesn't belabor the point after it has successfully disabled its prey; most dundraths slaughter their victims quickly and efficiently.

Dundraths prefer to hunt alone in order to savor the choicest cuts of meat for themselves. Particularly social dundraths or a dundrath parent might take back some meager scraps for the group. Other than this practice of sharing leftovers, dundrath society is surprisingly unsophisticated, especially considering the creatures' superficial resemblances to humans and elephants-two especially social creatures.

## Trunk Piercings

Dundraths do practice one form of "art," though it is unappreciated to all but the dundraths themselves. From the age it can hold a sharp stick, a dundrath will painfully pierce its trunk by jabbing a frozen wooden stake into its thick hide. As it grows older, a dundrath practices this self-piercing with increasingly larger stakes and, eventually, whole logs. The ritual is equal parts practicality (log-laden trunks make powerful swinging weapons and even shields) and vanity, for the dundraths with the biggest or most elaborate piercings also often command the most respect.
