Terrestrial societies have made a number of ill-fated journeys to the stars. Humanoids often take companions on such trips, and diminutive house drakes—the favored pets of the rich and powerful in certain metropolises—are no exception. Yet, as evidenced by the corrupt and malignant beings that often return from extraplanetary expeditions, perhaps it is better for some beings to simply stay home.

While many who return from the void are changed, it seems that house drakes are especially prone to such changes—and rarely for the better. Twisted by great evil beings residing in the farthest corners of space, these drakes continue their former activities of collecting hoards, terrorizing imps, and consorting with students of arcane academies, but with little of the carefree joy they may have once exhibited. All their capricious fervor is replaced with conniving, ruthless malice. Furthermore, these warped individuals bear none of the friendly nature that house drakes are known for and tend to spend much of their time brooding over stolen treasures.

The transformed house drake's appearance is what gives these creatures their moniker; their formerly lustrous and healthy violet scales change to a matte, bruised purple-black that scatters no light. Even the drake itself seems to cast no shadow, or its shadow is otherwise hazy and indistinct even in the hardest light. A shadowless house drake's tail also bears signs of the malformation, seemingly broken and rendered lifeless.

## Worlds of Potential

Like typical [[Bestiary 3/House Drake|House Drakes]], shadowless house drakes are almost exclusively found in certain cosmopolitan cities. Unlike their mundane brethren, however, these shadowy dragons are not bound to just one planet. Indeed, their bizarre interactions with the greater cosmos has planted descendants of the original shadowless house drakes on every celestial body in the solar system.
