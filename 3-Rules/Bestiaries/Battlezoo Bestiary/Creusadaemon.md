Creusadaemons are the daemonic incarnation of death by fever. Manifesting as humanoid fleas with reptilian mouths and eyes, these daemons boast amazing leaping abilities thanks to their long, powerful legs. Their four arms end in slender humanoid hands, which work frenetically on whatever fiendish task the creusadaemon has been tasked with. Like fleas, a creusadaemon's limbs and backs are covered in long, hard, needle-like bristles; unlike fleas, these monsters can pluck and fire their bristles like bolts from their infernal crossbows.

These vile daemons love nothing so much as watching a mortal's body turn on itself as it desperately tries to root out whatever disease, illness, or malady has struck it. To creusadaemons, a victim's burning fever, chilling shakes, and phlegmatic cough combine to create a beautiful symphony of agony. To other daemons, however, a creusadaemon's meddling is sometimes more of a detriment than a boon; the same magical fever that a creusadaemon induces in a mortal can, in fact, ultimately purge the victim of the disease inflicted on it by some other daemon. No matter to the creusadaemon-so long as there is a chance of the person dying of a fever, this monstrous flea cares little about anything else.

## Nuisance to All

When encountered in a group, creusadaemons often consort with other daemons whose dominion causes or overlaps with high fevers and sickly symptoms, such as leukodaemons and piscodaemons. However, creusadaemons are highly unpredictable, bouncing from foe to foe and even inadvertently curing diseased adversaries, and so many other daemons view their flealike kin as the nuisance that they are.
