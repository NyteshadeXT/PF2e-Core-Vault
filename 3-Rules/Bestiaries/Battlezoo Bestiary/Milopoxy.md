Obsessed with grandiose tales of chivalry and stories of great heroes who protect the weak, milopoxies are lithe humanoid fey who wander the world imitating these legends between fits of delusion and whimsy. Unfortunately for others, milopoxies don't truly understand the concepts of empathy or selflessness. Far from really aiding anyone, these selfish cavaliers—which are also known poetically as "misguided protectors"—tend to expend all their energy boasting about imagined heroic deeds and imploring evildoers to beware of their righteous blades. Yet, in spite of a milopoxy's obliviousness, this over-the-top distraction technique occasionally works.

## Oblivious Guardian

More often than not, a milopoxy's ward ends up dead from exhaustion or neglect since milopoxies have no need for food or water and believe that everlasting glory is more than enough sustenance to live on. Particularly aloof milopoxies might continue carrying a dead protégé for years, only disposing of the corpse after stumbling upon a more prestigious creature to "protect."
