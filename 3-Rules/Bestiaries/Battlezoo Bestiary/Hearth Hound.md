Few can wish for a more peaceful death than in one's sleep before the warmth of the family fireplace. When a cherished canine companion so peacefully passes away after spending its entire life with one family in one home, the spirit of the hound might linger within the embers and ashes of the hearth. Here the spirit remains, guarding its former home and family even after death, sometimes lingering in the home for a century or more in order to watch over its original family's children and grandchildren.

In its dormant form, this spirit is detectable as little more the feeling of warmth, contentment, and peace that radiates from the hearth; thus, a family might remain unaware of a hearth hound's existence for years or even decades. However, once the hearth hound senses a threat against its wards, such as a violent burglar, an arsonist, or even simply an exploitative tax collector, the beast instantly manifests from the flames of the family hearth to defend its loved ones.

## Rare Guardians

It is impossible to intentionally create or summon a hearth hound, and those who actively seek protection from one rarely receive it. Only by cherishing and caring for a dog throughout its entire life can a family hope to be blessed by this guardian spirit.

## Loyal Protectors

In its manifested form, a hearth hound resembles a plume of living ash in the shape of a giant dog, casting light from the glowing embers of its eyes and emitting a deep rumbling growl that shakes the foundations of the house. A hearth hound bravely protects its family from attackers and chases away threats, loyal to the very end.
