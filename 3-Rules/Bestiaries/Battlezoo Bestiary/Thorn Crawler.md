Thorn crawlers resemble massive centipedes made entirely of twisted roots, branches, vines, and undergrowth, with every inch of the monstrosity's body covered in razor-sharp thorns. These carnivorous plant creatures roam only the world's most primeval forests, using their ability to scent blood from a mile away to track down and consume injured prey. Despite their massive size, thorn crawlers are adept at navigating dense forests; they easily squeeze under tree roots and scurry through weed-choked gulches, even climbing into the forest canopy to better survey the ground and get the drop on unsuspecting prey.

Like many carnivorous plants, thorn crawlers feed on bodily fluids, leeching blood and humors into their root systems. A thorn crawler's digestive organs, such as they are, are located along the inner diameter of a hollow cavity in the monster's body. Thorn crawlers tuck captured forest critters and unwary travelers in this cavity, piercing its prey with sharp roots and swiftly draining the creature of vital fluids. Days later, a thorn crawler unceremoniously expels the victim's desiccated husk onto the forest floor.

A newly introduced thorn crawler can challenge a forest's apex predators and decimate the local ecosystem if left unchecked. Rulers of nations whose forests are beleaguered by thorn crawlers sometimes arrange for formal hunts of the creatures. Because the peasantry would turn such a hunt into little more than a slash and burn of the entire forest, rulers prefer to send adventurers who have a lighter touch to hunt down and eliminate the pesky plants.

## Variant Thorn Crawlers

Their ability to traverse a wide variety of terrain means that thorn crawlers can be found in forests throughout the world. Those in temperate forests typically become dormant during the winter, slumbering in thicketed ravines; those in tropical climates, however, are active year-round. Some species develop a natural paralytic poison that afflicts anyone on the wrong end of their thorns, while others have been afflicted by powerful consumed magic items or artifacts which have unlocked theretofore unknown primal powers.
