The cavernous spaces that exist beneath the tumultuous frenzy of the realm of the fey are no less dangerous than the primal lands above. More than one explorer has stumbled upon a particularly shiny moss-covered gemstone, only to discover a moment later that what they took at first for a simple pretty rock was, in fact, a fey creature made of living stone, crystal armor, and brilliant moss—an othruni.

In size and stature, othruni superficially resemble dwarves of the Material Plane. They also share dwarves' love of caves and other underground places. It is unsurprising, then, that dwarven adventurers traveling through the fey realm tend to get along with othruni.

An othruni's body not only resembles stone and crystal and moss—it _is_ stone and crystal and moss. This symbiotic relationship between rock, mineral, and fungus is the othruni itself; if any of these three aspects of its being is destroyed, the othruni is likewise destroyed.

Despite their shared promise to keep the nature of their physiologies secret, othruni are fiercely individualistic and stubborn-minded, even when teamwork is obviously the most practical solution. Othruni caravans, which gather to excavate large deposits of orus crystals, are chaotic and rambunctious affairs. Many othruni forego caravans entirely and prefer the company of non-othruni to their own kinfolk, though othruni's unusual physiology makes it difficult for these fey to establish longterm traveling partners outside the winding warrens of the fey's world.

## Othruni Moss and Orus Crystals

Othruni are covered in photosensitive moss called othruni moss, which crumbles quickly when exposed to direct sunlight. The moss covers an othruni's entire body and even its equipment, and it plays an important role in reinforcing the othruni's crystal-embedded stone armor. Like othruni moss, these rare "orus crystals" are native to the realm of fey; where to find orus crystals and how to craft with them are the greatest secrets of othruni people.
