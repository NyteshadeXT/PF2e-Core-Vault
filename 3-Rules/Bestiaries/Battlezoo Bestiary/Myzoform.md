A myzoform is an amalgam of magically modified lampreys fused together into a single humanoid shape. Its head is a writhing mass of lampreys which collectively act as the creature's eyes, ears, and mouths. Myzoforms come about when a mundane lamprey is accidentally exposed to strange and powerful magics—be it from the monstrous aboleths, wild sorcerers, or even natural sources. As a result of its exposure, the lamprey becomes pre-sapient, allowing it to feed on and digest creatures' memories as easily as a normal lamprey sucks blood.

When such a pre-sapient lamprey attaches itself to another pre-sapient lamprey, the two create a kind of feedback loop as their minds interconnect and feed on and regurgitate one another's increasingly broken and bizarre memories. The lampreys then look for more lampreys to turn into their body, and the process snowballs until a myzoform is born.

At this stage, a myzoform can survive on its own experiences and memories, but most myzoforms find themselves addicted to the "fresh" memories of other creatures. These thirsty creatures are often found haunting towns, cities, and other urban centers rich with potential prey on whose minds they can absorb. When a myzoform strikes from the shadows and latches onto the mind of an unfortunate local, they absorb everything—personality, memories, knowledge—and leave in their wake only an amnesiac.

The most gluttonous and malicious myzoforms have fed on countless minds throughout their lives, and they might contain hundreds or even thousands of consumed personalities. As the number of minds inside them increases, only the most powerful myzoforms can stay in control; most eventually break down and self-destruct as their collective minds become a civil war of different fears, ideologies, and motivations

## Crisis of Consciences

Although some myzoforms can be genuinely malicious, those are rare. Many myzoforms feel highly guilty over their nigh unstoppable impulse to feed on other sapient beings. Some rationalize their behavior by saying they can't control their impulses, while others might try to cure themselves of their "curse" and seek outside help to overcome their insatiable addiction.
