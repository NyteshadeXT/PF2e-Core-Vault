A monstrosity of liquified flesh and bone, the necroflesh monarch is an undead ooze made from the muscle, fat, and sinew of countless victims, all turned toward undeath and combined into one pulsing, hulking form.

Necroflesh monarchs wander aimlessly between remote villages, across desolate deserts, and beneath venerable mountains, always on the hunt for more victims to add to their quivering, corpulent body. When a monarch swallows a living creature, the victim struggles for breath before eventually succumbing to the ooze's life-leaching internal acids. The flesh and bone of a slain victim melt and become subsumed into the monarch's corpulent, amorphous form. In this way, a necroflesh monarch grows in both size and power.

Strangely, and perhaps thankfully, a necroflesh monarch makes no distinction between prey of high or low provenance. To these mindless meat-beings, the most regal queen is of equal value to the lowliest peasant.

The signs of a necroflesh monarch attack are obvious to anyone who knows what to look for: crushed houses, steaming puddles of black bile, and not a single body in sight. This latter clue is perhaps the eeriest aspect of necroflesh monarchs. For all their brutish simplicity, these oozy behemoths know at least enough not waste a single morsel.

## Army of Bones

Though mindless, the necroflesh monarch possesses a few clever, if rudimentary, survival instincts. For instance, to make sure it never goes without a meal, a monarch tends to keep a troop or even a small army of skeletal warriors by its side at all times. These mindless undead follow the same primeval protocols as the necroflesh monarch, plodding aimlessly along and swinging their limbs violently to attack.

The skeletons that follow a necroflesh monarch might be any level, though all are mindless. Regardless of how strong its skeletal companions might be, a monarch doesn't rely on its bony minions for protectionâ€”rather, it keeps them as a mobile food source to tap into during lean times.
