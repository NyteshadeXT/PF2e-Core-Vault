Created by vampires and planted in their dour garden spaces, sanguine roses are slow-moving plants fertilized with the remains of victims who perished before the vampire could finish drinking their blood. The few remaining drops of blood in such fertilizer are enough to give this eerie flower its crimson hueâ€”or so the stories go. Whatever the case, sanguine roses combine the sturdy physiology and classical beauty of a rose bush with the unnatural and evil powers of undeath, making them terribly potent guardians of vampiric estates.

Usually planted in gardens or along exterior walls amid mundane plants that serve as camouflage, sanguine roses attack any living creatures that draw near in order to soak the soil around them with fresh blood. Like true roses, sanguine roses emit a pleasant aroma, but the odor of these monstrous plants is far more potent than any mundane flower. They draw humanoids and animals toward them using this seductive scent, then explode into a frenzy of thorny attacks.

A sanguine rose can easily be identified by its unnaturally dusky leaves and vines, which make its bright red flowers and inch-long thorns stand out all the more. Regardless of their telltale features, countless animals and humanoids fall prey to sanguine roses since knowledge of these wretched plants is a well-kept secret among vampires and other cunning undead.

Sanguine roses and their varieties can be created with the _[[Spells/Create Undead|Create Undead]]_ ritual like other undead. The caster of this ritual can substitute Nature (expert) for the usual primary skill check. This makes sanguine roses particularly popular among evil druids and their ilk.

## Grave Lilies

Several varieties of sanguine rose exist, including the much rarer grave lily, which supposedly feasts upon undead creatures rather than the living. Particularly ancient specimens of either variety have been known to gain a modest level of intelligence, and with it, foul primal magical powers such as _[[Spells/Toxic Cloud|Cloudkill]]_ or _[[Spells/Desiccate|Horrid Wilting]]_.
