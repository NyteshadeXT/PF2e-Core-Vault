  - name: "Fluidsense (Imprecise) (1 mile)"
    desc: "  Salt stalkers can detect fluids up to a mile away, from large bodies of water to potions to even the blood in a prey animal's body. This is an imprecise sense, and salt stalkers cannot pick out smaller amounts of liquid within large amounts of liquid. For example, a salt stalker couldn't detect a creature hiding within a lake with fluidsense, only the lake."

  - name: "Water Vulnerability"
    desc: "  Water rapidly degrades the spines that cover a salt stalker. A salt stalker immersed in water, stuck in a rain storm, or otherwise soaked is Slowed 1.\nSpells or effects that temporarily drench a salt stalker, such as _Hydraulic Push_ or a bucket of water, cause the salt stalker to become slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds.\nAs long as it is slowed in this way, a salt stalker cannot make spines Strikes."

  - name: "Ambush Attackers"
    desc: "  When two or more salt mothers are adjacent to the same foe, salt mothers' attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage to that foe."

  - name: "Barbed Spines"
    desc: "  A salt mother's spines have barbed tips and are much stronger than other salt stalkers', easily becoming lodged in victims and allowing the salt mother's desiccating bile to sink deeper into the victim's body. When a salt mother deals damage with her tail or spines Strike, the damaged creature becomes Enfeebled 1 (or Enfeebled 2 on a critical hit). As long as the spines are embedded in the creature, the result of the creature's saving throws against desiccation venom are one degree worse than whatever the creature rolls.\nA creature can remove spines from itself or an adjacent ally by spending 1 action to perform a Medicine check (this action has the Interact trait). On a failed check, the spines are still removed, but the creature takes 2d8 piercing damage."

  - name: "Desiccation Venom"
    desc: " (injury,poison) A salt stalker's teeth and spines inflict a terrible, toxic bile that violently dehydrates the target, making them more susceptible to heat. The sickened condition and weakness to fire can't end or be reduced until the poison is cured;\n**Saving Throw** Fortitude;\n**Maximum Duration** 1 hour;\n**Stage 1** 2d4 + 4 poison damage plus weakness to fire 3 (1 minute);\n**Stage 2** 2d6 + 4 poison damage plus weakness to fire 6 (1 minute);\n**Stage 3** 2d8 + 4 poison damage plus Sickened 1 and weakness to fire 9 (10 minutes)"

  - name: "Frenzied Hiss"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,emotion,mental,primal) The salt mother hisses terribly, spurring her entire pack into a violent frenzy. The salt mother and all salt stalkers within 60 feet deal 4 additional damage with melee Strikes and take a -1 status penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 minute, after which affected creatures are temporarily immune to the salt mother's Frenzied Hiss for 1 hour.\nWhen a salt mother uses Frenzied Hiss, each affected salt stalker can spend its reaction to Stride up to its Speed, but it must end its movement closer to either the salt mother or a visible enemy.\nEffect: Frenzied Hiss"

In the largest salt stalker burrows, the hulking matriarch called the salt mother reigns supreme. Other salt stalkers fear and respect the salt mother due to her size, her strength, and her vital role to the pack. Like a queen bee, the salt mother oversees, commands, and produces all the salt stalkers beneath her.

Beyond hunting for food and maintaining the security of their territory, salt stalkers' overarching objective is to ensure the safety and prosperity of their mother. Intruders should make no mistake, though—a salt mother on her own is far from defenseless. Her thick spines are massive enough to impale creatures and inject ounces of toxic venom at a time. Likewise, anyone caught on the wrong end of a salt mother's tail are sure to receive a face full of these terrible barbed weapons.

## Salt Stalker Heroes

Common salt stalkers cower helplessly beneath the dominating power of a particularly strong variety of salt stalker such as a salt scorcher or salt mother. Rarely, a common salt stalker hero might rise from the rest of its kin in order to defeat and displace a pack's resident bully or tyrant. Such packs tend to be much happier and more democratic as a result of their champion's usurpation—at least until this "hero" gets a bit too cocky during hunts or lax with caretaking duties, in which case the violent cycle is apt to repeat itself.

## Salt Stalker

Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.

Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.
