Galtzagorri are diminutive, fretful humanoids native to the realm of the fey. They wear baggy, bright red pants and sport ladybug-like wings on their bare backs. Whether in flight or on foot, galtzagorri flit about with purpose, zigzagging between trees and buildings with equal ease. On the Material Plane, galtzagorri tend to avoid big cities but might be found in woodland settlements or any heavily forested area that resembles their wild home.

For a galtzagorri, unemployment is a fate worse than death. Its nimble fingers twitching with anticipation, an unoccupied galtzagorri is prone to buzz about the land in search of overworked artisans, beleaguered farmers, and frazzled spellcasters eager to delegate their menial tasks. Once bonded to a skilled practitioner or spellcaster, a galtzagorri goes about any task, big or small, with enthusiasm, from tinkering with a malfunctioning construct to washing the windows. Galtzagorri are also helpful in battle, all too eager to swiftly disarm and disassemble their enemies' weapons.

While its bonded master may initially see the creature as a blessing, a galtzagorri's relentless industriousness can also be a curse. An underworked galtzagorri quickly becomes agitated, undoing with frenetic anxiety the tasks it has already completed. If completely idle, it may even sabotage simple mechanical devices only so that it can fix them again. An artisan or spellcaster can rid themselves of an unwanted galtzagorri by trapping it in a small box and gifting it to another who may need the creature's "help."

## Galtzagorri Possessions

Money and ownership are so inconsequential to a galtzagorri that it would have no qualms about scratching a priceless jewel in an effort to fix a twisted prong. Any galtzagorri missing its oversized red pants-its one prized possession-has presumably sacrificed them in the name of completing some exceptionally satisfying task.
