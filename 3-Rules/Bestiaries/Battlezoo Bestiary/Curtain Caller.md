A curtain caller manifests from the shared horror of an entire company of performers whose stage production became their deathtrap. These dozens of souls are trapped and compounded into a single tortured, wrathful entity, doomed to haunt its theatre for eternity. Only the bravest and most talented troupe of heroes can hope to reenact the spirit's fateful performance to its climax and, in doing so, put the curtain caller to rest at last.

Curtain callers have egos as big as their own ghostly forms, and they despise anyone who dares to interrupt their singing with a counter-performance. Conversely, a performer who plays along with or augments the curtain caller's eternal concert might win the caller's favor—so long as the interloper makes no attempt to upstage or outdo the spirit.

## Soulful Songsters

A curtain caller can speak and understand whatever languages its constituent souls understood in life, but the entity never willfully communicates in a clear or calm manner. Rather, curtain callers are divas even in death, compelled to constantly sing, serenade, shriek, or croon—even to an empty audience.

## Sitebound Spirit

When a mass tragedy like a shipwreck or theatre fire claims the lives of sailors, performers, or other inhabitants whose identities were inextricably tied to the vessel or building in which they perished, the end result is often a malevolent spirit such as a wispy wayfarer. These ghostly beings cling to the Material Plane with a vengeance, assuming billowy shapes that reflect the trappings of their sacred place of work.
