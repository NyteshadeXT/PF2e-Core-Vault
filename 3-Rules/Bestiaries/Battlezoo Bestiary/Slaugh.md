```encounter-table
name: Slaugh
creatures:
  - 1: Slaugh
```



Slaughs are towering undead abominations who lead powerful armies of skeletons, ghouls, and other unliving horrors. Clad only in simple rags and wielding a fearsome skull-bedecked scythe, the slaugh strikes an imposing image whether at the forefront of a zombie militia or amid the center of a bloodthirsty vampire mob.

A troop led by a slaugh is a troop to be feared. Although they are not necessarily tactical masterminds, slaughs can push their units to their physical limits using profane powers to inspire and intimidate in equal measure. That said, slaughs are never content to sit on the sidelines while their minions do the fun work of slaughtering enemies. Slaughs wade into the battlefield with glee, setting a prime example for their underlings in the ways of war and brutality.

Slaughs arise not from a single restless soul but from many. In order to create a slaugh, a necromancer must collect a retinue of formidable souls, each from a different army, militia, or war partyâ€”only the strongest and most imposing warriors will do. Then, a single hulking corpse is used to bind these souls into one being. Each of the dozens of magical runes etched upon a slaugh's body represent a separate soul bound to the monster. A slaugh can tap into the power of its constituent souls to either release waves of potent necromantic energy or funnel incredible power into its devastating strikes.

## Traitorous Commanders

Though the methods for creating slaughs are well known to lich kings and vampire overlords alike, few necromancers dare to raise such beings for their necrotic armies because slaughs have an outsized reputation for treachery and betrayal. Perhaps this trait shouldn't come as a surprise, considering the combative nature of the numerous souls that compose a slaugh. At any rate, the fact remains that even the most loyal-seeming slaugh can be trusted for only so long.
