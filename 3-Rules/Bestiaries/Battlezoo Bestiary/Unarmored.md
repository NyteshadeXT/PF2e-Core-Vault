The unarmored attempts to sever the target's connection to its armor and whisk the armor to the Ethereal Plane. The target must attempt a Will save.\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n**Failure** The creature's bond to its armor isn't strong enough to withstand the unarmored's meddling. The creature's armor turns ghostly and translucent as it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. The armor is instantly unequipped and becomes invisible and untouchable to creatures on the Material Plane. After 1 round, the armor rematerializes in the nearest empty space to where it was last worn.\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the armor remains on the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. The armor rematerializes on the Material Plane in a random direction within 100 feet of where it was last worn."

Few things frustrate adventurers more than when essential gear goes missing, and this is doubly true for warriors and their precious armor. When a fighter spends their final moments lamenting their fate—believing they would have survived if only they had been wearing better armor—the individual's anger, despair, and obsession can cause their spirit to rise as an unarmored.

Anchored to the location of their demise and unable to move on from their grim fate, unarmored desire only two things: to acquire the perfect suit of armor and to inflict their tragedy upon others. They bear great hatred for anyone wearing particularly spectacular gear. To ensure such well-equipped individuals suffer the same loss as it, an unarmored spirits away its victim's armor to the Ethereal Plane before mercilessly striking down the suddenly unprotected warrior.

## Ethereal Extraction

Adventurers who know that they might run up against an unarmored do well to prepare an ethereal jaunt spell or other means of quickly going back and forth between the Material and Ethereal Planes. Doing so allows victims of the unarmored's armor-teleporting powers to quickly retrieve their equipment. Such preparations can dramatically stymie—and enrage—an unarmored.
