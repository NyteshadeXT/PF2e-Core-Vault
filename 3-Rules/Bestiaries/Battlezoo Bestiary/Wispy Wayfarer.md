When the wispy wayfarer damages a living creature with its wispy tatters Strike, the target must make a DC 18 Will save. On a failure, the target can't speak or use any abilities or actions with the auditory or sonic trait, including casting spells that include verbal components. This effect lasts until the end of the wayfarer's next turn. On a critical failure, the effect lasts 1 minute."

When a greedy soul perishes amid the wreckage of a treasure-laden pirate ship, sometimes their desire to keep stolen booty overrides their spirit's natural ascent to the afterlife. Such is the case for wispy wayfarers, whose essence is infused with the suffocating violence of the maelstrom that swallowed up its living body. Adventurers looking for forgotten bounties aboard a sunken or beached shipwreck would do well to watch out for this ghastly warden.

Wispy wayfarers generally guard a shipwreck alongside sturdier corporeal undead such as draugr. They prefer not to announce their presence, perhaps hiding in plain sight as a ragged cloak strewn over a cobwebbed stair rail. Once battle is joined, they take advantage of their ability to pass through walls and floors to creep up on and silence any spellcasters, especially clerics and champions. Because their own last words were lost in the raging wind and rain of a terrible storm, nothing disturbs a wispy wayfarer more than mortal prayers. From afar a wayfarer is hauntingly silent, though upon approaching the thing one can hear a soft howl, as of distant winds.

A wispy wayfarer resembles a humanoid skull missing its lower jaw and with coins over its eye sockets. The skull hovers above the animated tatters of an old canvas sailcloth draped over a disembodied ship mast. The sail flaps in a slow-motion fury, even when there is no wind present, as though constantly remembering the storm that sent it to its doom.

## Easy Loot

A wispy wayfarer's raging soul can be quieted only once all the treasure aboard its ship is removedâ€”a challenge most adventuring parties wholeheartedly welcome. However, if even one copper piece remains aboard its ship, the wayfarer will continue to manifest, stubborn to the end.

## Sitebound Spirit

When a mass tragedy like a shipwreck or theatre fire claims the lives of sailors, performers, or other inhabitants whose identities were inextricably tied to the vessel or building in which they perished, the end result is often a malevolent spirit such as a wispy wayfarer. These ghostly beings cling to the Material Plane with a vengeance, assuming billowy shapes that reflect the trappings of their sacred place of work.
