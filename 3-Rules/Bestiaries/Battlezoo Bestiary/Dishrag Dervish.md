Clattering down stained hallways, sloshing across warped bars, and looming in dusty closets, the swarming spirits called dishrag dervishes haunt the ruins of pubs, bars, and other communal places of libationary indulgence.

The hardest-working employees of public houses and taverns—waiters, servants, bar hands, and others at the bottom rungs of the business—typically sustain the most abuse and indignity from guests and employers alike. Tragically, when destruction visits the establishment in the form of riotous mobs or belligerent arsonists, these same workers are also among the most likely to perish in the attack. Perhaps it is no wonder, then, why sometimes in the aftermath of an attack these poor souls refuse to move onto the afterlife until the indignities they've suffered have been set right.

To haunt the building that caused them so much agony in life, these vengeful souls manifest as grubby dishrags, splintered brooms, and buckets of scummy dishwater that clatter across the drinking hall and terrorize anyone who still dares patronize the sinful business. It isn't long before the haunted drinking establishment goes out of business completely; yet, still, a dishrag dervish will go on haunting the ruins of its former tormentors until the last drop of alcohol is scrubbed from the building's floorboards.

## Tempestuous Teetotalers

In abandoned taverns, dishrag dervishes hide in plain sight as discarded cleaning supplies or common trash until their sordid domain is disturbed. These spirits particularly despise rowdy revelers, unrepentant litterers, and anyone who openly worships a god of debauchery or libations. In combat, a dishrag dervish will single-mindedly target such bacchants and braggadocios, ignoring all others until it has slaked its thirst for vengeance.

## Sitebound Spirit

When a mass tragedy like a shipwreck or theatre fire claims the lives of sailors, performers, or other inhabitants whose identities were inextricably tied to the vessel or building in which they perished, the end result is often a malevolent spirit such as a wispy wayfarer. These ghostly beings cling to the Material Plane with a vengeance, assuming billowy shapes that reflect the trappings of their sacred place of work.
