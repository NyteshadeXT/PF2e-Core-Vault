As their common name implies, hook hangers (who refer to themselves as danakarii) are monstrous abominations that haunt jungles both verdant and urban. They prefer these environs because trees and buildings alike boast plentiful branches, ledges, and crannies from which they can swing and drop. Though hook hangers are bipedal, their legs are little more than vestigial stumps. Rather, these killers locomote by swinging along tree canopies and permeable ceilings using the strange hooked limbs that extend from their shoulder blades. Hook hangers can lope along the ground using their heavily muscled arms, similarly to gorillas, but they generally resort to terrestrial combat only as a last resort. Whenever possible, they hide in darkness above their prey and fight from the shadows.

Hook hangers are misanthropic killers who disdain all other forms of life and find great pleasure in killing and maiming just about anything that crosses their path. They move with eerie silent grace and communicate with one another using an Aklo form of sign language, but they clearly possess the power of hearing, for their favorite types of victims are those who can scream.

Hook hangers sometimes gather in groups and follow a particularly charismatic and vile hanger. Such "hook mobs" can wipe out entire settlements or regions of life, foregoing their usual stealth and ambush tactics for wanton slaughter. More often, however, hook hangers act as solitary hunters or independent mercenaries for more powerful beings.

## Unknown Origins

Hook hangers are encountered all over the world and in just about any locale, from insular riverside villages to the heart of the jungle to the depths of subterranean caverns, making it difficult to determine their "native habitat." The most logical explanation for hook hangers' proliferation is that some malevolent intelligent being purposefully sowed these horrors across the world, though what being—and for what purpose—none can say.
