While the astringent armor is attached to a creature, it inhabits the same space as the creature and moves whenever the creature moves. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to Speed.

Suits of astringent armor are dangerous animated constructs found in abandoned dungeons, cursed fortresses, and the strongholds of powerful spellcasters. Wherever they're found, these mindless abominations protect their master's treasures faithfully and often unfailingly.

In its purest form, astringent armor resembles a simple empty suit of plate mail or other armor common to the region. More often than not, though, adventurers stumble upon an astringent armor after it has already claimed at least one victim. Horrifyingly, though they are mindless, suits of astringent armor seem to prefer walking around with their latest victim still crushed inside-at least until they find a fresher body to enshroud and destroy. In such cases, the astringent armor is mistaken for an armor-clad zombie or other undead, a mistake that has put many would-be thieves in an early grave. Closer inspection, however, reveals that the encased body is horribly crushed and mangled, and bits of bone and flesh stick out sickeningly through the joints in the armor's plates.

In combat, suits of astringent armor single-mindedly grab their victims, then attempt to reassemble themselves around their prey. Once attached, the armor begins shrinking, slowly crushing the unfortunate body trapped within.

## Varied Origins

Suits of astringent armor most commonly come about via arcane rituals, similar to those used to animate other mundane objects. Sometimes though, they manifest in other ways-such as from a curse placed on an armor-wearing warrior who betrayed the wrong witch, a fiend who possessed a suit of armor but subsequently lost its identity, or simply from raw evil energy seeping into armor from the Negative Energy Plane. In all of these cases, such suits of astringent armor possess just a bit more intellect than most of their kind, as well as a spark of genuine wickedness.
