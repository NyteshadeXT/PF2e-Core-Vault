Eekos are squat living bushes that grow around a primordial golden beehive from the fey realm. Many mistake the plant matter itself for the eeko, but the honeycomb "heart" and its constituent bees are the real animating force of this benevolent fey.

Eekos prefer to live in forest groves and sun-dappled woodlands, where they mingle with other fey and occasionally help guide wayward travelers and animals, only attacking if they or their home are threatened. To eekos, nature is sacred, and most see themselves as stewards of the natural cycles of birth and death, feast and famine, renewal and decay. Most eekos are brave in a fight, sometimes recklessly so, and see adventure around every trunk.

Although they harbor no love for humans or other creatures that often despoil wilderness in the name of "civilization," eekos do enjoy the company of druids, especially vagabonds with stories of far-off places and unusual animals. Eekos cannot speak, but they love the sounds that voices can make, and they're happy to offer aid in exchange for stories and songs-even bad ones. Arboreals tend to be too plodding or methodical to maintain an eeko's attention, though the two creatures gladly work together to defend their shared homes from invaders.

## Eeko Hearts

The golden heart of an eeko is no mere honeycomb-it is the essence of life itself. A destroyed eeko's heart provides enough nourishment to feed 30 Medium creatures for a day (or 15 Medium creatures for 2 days, and so forth). After 1 week, the heart dissolves and turns into just a handful of nonmagical pollen.
