Afneiths are nocturnal eight-legged felines native to arid southern deserts. Their large bodies strike a distinctive silhouette on moonlit nights: serrated claws, wide jaws, and oversized ears combine to form the image of a natural-born killer. Though these powerful predators were not born-they were made.

The first afneith was created by a cabal of desert-dwelling druids who served a cat-adoring pharaoh. When the pharaoh died, her will stipulated that her tomb not be guarded by constructs or soldiers but by a feline beast of her own peculiar specifications. The druids worked tirelessly to create such a beast, enlisting royal clerics and wizards to aid their quest. In the end, they created a beast so fearsome that they were only too glad to lock it away in their pharaoh's tomb. As a safeguard in case the beast should escape, the spellcasters ensured that the afneith had an easily exploitable weakness to the belladonna herb-a weakness that they tried to keep secret but which has inevitably become common knowledge to sarcophagus-robbing treasure hunters.

Afneiths physically differ from their typical cat relatives in several ways. Their massive pointed ears act like funnels for sound, allowing them to pinpoint even the stealthiest tomb robbers. With their flexible skeletal structure and slack flesh, afneiths have little trouble slinking through tight corridors and alcoves to reposition and get the edge in an encounter. Finally, they possess an advanced intellect that allows them to override some of their feline instincts and invent complex strategies.

## "Domesticated" Afneiths

Afneiths have long spread beyond the pharaonic mausoleums in which they were initially confined. Desert travelers who overcome their initial fright might hope to befriend the wandering beast; afneiths are supposedly loyal friends once their trust is earned with food and affection. Skeptics claim that afneiths nearly always appear aloof to others' needs and seem primarily motivated by food and play. Conversely, afneith supporters point out that many humanoids are motivated by these same things.
