When seen from a distance, there is little to distinguish the reaver beaver from its more innocuous namesake, save its much larger size. Upon closer examination, the differences become obvious and terrifying. Glowing red eyes filled with hate squint over a snarling, acid-coated maw dominated by two incisors the size of daggers. A thick, leathery tail covered in jagged barbs extends from the back of a stocky frame which is up to 8 feet long and can weigh over 300 pounds.

Prevailing wisdom suggests that evil druids created reaver beavers as a weapon to unleash upon settlers and despoilers of nature, but no one can claim to know the monsters' origins for certain. What is known for sure is that reaver beavers possess a malicious intellect entirely out of line with their animalistic forebears and that they are driven to terrorize anyone who encroaches upon their domain. Hunters, farmers, and miners are all often targets of their predations. Reaver beavers seem to harbor a specific hatred for lumberjacks; often the first signs of a nearby colony of reaver beavers are the remains of a destroyed lumber camp or sawmill. Survivors who can speak of the assault are rare, but the monsters' grisly tendency to gnaw off their victims' legs and leave the shredded appendages behind leave little doubt as to the culprits.

Reaver beavers are equally as industrious as normal beavers, but, in a perverse echo of their natural kin, they favor not wood as their primary building material but rather the bodies of their victims. Horrific "corpse dams" upriver from settlements can obstruct the flow of water as well as befoul it with disease. Reaver beavers' colonies are constructed in the same way, often supplementing humanoid corpses with those of other animals to create obscene mounds of rotting flesh. These gruesome dens are usually built near the shore of a lake and extend underneath the surface, with the entrance accessible only by diving beneath the fetid water.

## Reaver Beaver Tactics

In combat, reaver beavers unleash volleys of acidic spittle before swarming forward in an ungainly rush. They often work in tandem with disturbing coordination, one attacking a target's legs to topple them to the ground, the other using its powerful tail to pulverize the now-prone victim.
