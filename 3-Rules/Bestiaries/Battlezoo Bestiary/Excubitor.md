Devils have a reputation for being diabolical masterminds, but not all of them live up to that reputation. Excubitors, also known as chaperone devils, are forged from the souls of mortals who aided and abetted the evils of others rather than committing their own atrocities. In Hell, despite their formidable power, excubitors rank quite low in the diabolic hierarchy as they rarely achieve any triumphs which they can truly call their own.

The reward for a devil who in life was "just following orders" is an eternity of following the orders of mortals. Chaperone devils specialize in protecting Hell's most important mortal assets-villains, criminal masterminds, and satanic warlords whose capacity for scheming overshadows their physical acumen. Excubitors are contracted to protect these important individuals from would-be law officers, knights, and other do-gooders. More than one would-be hero has nearly confronted a heinous villain only to first fall to that villain's "secretary"-a fiendish excubitor bodyguard, with fists like iron and an almost bottomless pit of a stomach.

## Fiendish Partners

A phistophilus (also called a contract devil; see the Pathfinder Second Edition Bestiary) can assign an excubitor to protect a mortal as part of the contract signed by that mortal. Excubitors cannot create new contracts themselves. The mortal beneficiary of this contract is known as the "principal."
