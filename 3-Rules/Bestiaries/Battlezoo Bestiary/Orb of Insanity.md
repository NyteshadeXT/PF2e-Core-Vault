In the dark corners of the Material Plane, elder things sleep. Sometimes when an inquisitive soul uses a crystal ball to scry on one of these entities, the entity gazes back. Such an entity can possess the crystal ball and absorb the essence of its beholder by caging the scryer in a prison of glass. The entity then animates the orb so that it can loose its own malevolent presence from beyond the stars.

## Worlds of Madness

An orb of insanity searches the cosmos for beings eager to glean occult knowledge. It tempts these people with dangerous insight, leading them down a path of wonder and madness. The orb encourages its students to take on pupils of their own; if unchecked, an orb of insanity can lead an entire society into derangement, reeling from the weight of alien knowledge.
