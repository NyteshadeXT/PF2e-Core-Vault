A squirming mass of vermin sewn into a skin sack, mogadbs are created as servitor creatures and protectors by wicked fey. The creator finds or summons a large number of tiny animals—typically lizards, mice, and other minute reptiles and mammals—then enacts a ritual that ensorcells them into acting as a single large predatory beast. The ritual is completed when the enchanted swarm is sealed into a skin vessel of some kind. This vessel can be as simple as a rough sack vaguely shaped like a four-legged creature, as ornate as a lifelike plush toy, or even simply the preserved hide of a bear or great cat. No matter the vessel's appearance, the swarm animates it ably, and the mogadb serves its master unerringly.

While it has no central intelligence, a mogadb's constituent swarm nonetheless behaves like a single beast, prowling about on four "legs" and attacking with its limbs like a large quadruped, though it has a discernible boneless quality to its movement. Impacts cause the mogadb's skin to ripple, and the swarm inside is visible whenever the creature opens its mouth to feed or exhale vermin at foes. As the mogadb becomes damaged, rents and tears in the skin vessel reveal the writhing horde within, acting in eerie concert.

Many adventurers mistake mogadbs for animated objects or other types of magical construct creatures or occasionally even magic items like _bags of holding_. Trickster fey such as gremlins take great joy in such antics and craft their mogadbs with this exact goal in mind.

Particularly cruel fey have been known to craft whole packs of mogadbs, even riding them as war beasts, in the process totally draining an area of tiny animals to feed their rituals. Encountering a pack of mogadbs and their riders is a terrifying sight that few would welcome, and even fewer might live to tell about. Such acts rarely go unnoticed and often result in confrontations with druidic circles and well-meaning beings from the fey world.

## Destroying Mogadbs

A mogadb can be destroyed with a successful _Remove Curse_ spell, though it may be difficult to keep the creature in one place while casting. More powerful magic might be effective as well. Otherwise the only way to free the trapped animals from their wicked fate is by destroying the skin vessel and dispersing the swarm.
