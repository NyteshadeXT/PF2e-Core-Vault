On the outskirts of Purgatory, sometimes confused or stubborn spirits wander away, avoiding judgment and refusing to pass on to the afterlife. In these cases, psychopomps called fylakas are charged with tracking down these runaway souls and bringing them back to face judgment.

Though their ability to sense alive and undead creatures is not as precise as other psychopomps, fylakas can sniff out souls from incredible distances, and they are relentless in their pursuits. The mere sight of one of these skull-faced bloodhounds is often enough to motivate a wandering soul to fall back in line and, in this way, fylakas keep the flow of souls moving through purgatory both steady and orderly.

Physically, fylakas resemble oversized canines of various breeds, with mastiffs and bloodhounds being particularly common types. A skeletal mask mimicking the fylaka's own bone structure covers its face while its eyes glow and seep with flowing wisps of green and purple divine energy. When it rears up, the fylaka reveals its furless chest and, in its place, a large ribcage devoid of any innards.

## Soul Catchers

Fylakas rarely aim to destroy their quarry. For one thing, psychopomps aren't particularly in the business of destroying souls. Rather, fylakas instead try to trap and escort souls to where they need to be. Purgatory's hounds accomplish this by catching spirits in their expansive rib cages, within which divine energy weakens the prisoner and keeps it from escaping during the journey back.
