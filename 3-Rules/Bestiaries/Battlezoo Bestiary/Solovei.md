Soloveis are bizarre, flightless scavenger birds with powerful legs and beaked humanoid heads. They are best known for their morbid fascination with valuables; like magpies, soloveis are drawn to shiny trinkets and intricate baubles, and so these birds frequently menace adventurers and other humanoids who cross through their territory. A solovei subdues its prey with its supernaturally shrill screeching, which stuns nearby creatures, allowing the solovei to tear its helpless victims apart before absconding with their jewelry and coins. In this way, the aftermath of a solovei attack often resembles a fatal highway robbery, causing no shortage of confusion and panic in nearby villages.

Soloveis usually make their nests in the lower branches of large or intertwined trees, preferring to settle near roads where they can spot approaching prey while staying hidden. Their vestigial wings are all but useless, and so soloveis rely on their muscular legs and hand-like feet to scrabble up and down trees as needed.

The vibrations induced by a solovei's warbling are so powerful that they disrupt organic matter. This includes the very trees that soloveis call home. Thus, savvy travelers might notice and avoid a solovei's nest if they're able to recognize ahead of time the distinct patches of warped and decaying vegetation in the tree canopy above.

## Treasure Hoarders

Soloveis carry their stolen valuables back to their nests in order to decorate their lair and attract mates. Particularly successful soloveis can amass veritable hoards of looted trinkets, and these proud individuals often celebrate especially exciting additions to their collections with rapturous cries that can be heard from miles away.
