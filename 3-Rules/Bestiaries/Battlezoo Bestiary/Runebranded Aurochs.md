This wild bovine stands out among its ancient herd. Easily a hand taller, with darker leathery skin, pockmarked with glowing scars that look like incomplete runes, its eyes shine with an ornery light. It looks wary and ready for a fight, and its horns and hooves shine like polished metal.

In the wild places where the ancient breed of cattle known as aurochs roam, there are those specimens that, whether through magical accident, fate, or manipulation, develop to be even wilder, stronger, and deadlier than their already formidable kin, with powers over the very elements of the natural world. These extraordinary aurochs become legendary and prized among those who hunt such creatures for meat, leather, or sport or those who seek to tame such wild beasts. The strange markings that develop along their hides have given these creatures the name "runebranded aurochs," though other colorful names exist as well, such as elemental aurochs, storm cattle, and lightning bulls.

While a skinned runebranded aurochs can provide strong leather suitable for crafting, the rune markings on its hide rarely possess any lasting magic after the creature's death. Only the most powerful or eldest runebranded aurochs—those who have thrived in the wilds for an exceptionally long time or were otherwise subject to excessive whims of destiny—might bear runes on their hides capable of being transferred to weapons or armor. Such aurochs are apt to develop even stranger abilities such as magical flight, total immunity to their element, and even advanced size and intellect.

## Rarer Breeds

The runebranded aurochs presented here was created by a magically charged storm or some other electrical process. Although this is a common form of the animal, other sources can make runebranded aurochs attuned instead to fire, cold, or more exotic elements. Such aurochs possess similar abilities, but their attacks and resistances are of a different energy type.

## Unbreakable

A runebranded aurochs will rarely take a rider or do domesticated work willingly. Beastmasters may find means by which to keep such animals for show or as particularly brutish guard beasts, but runebranded aurochs will always try to break free in order to seek the wilds and other aurochs.
