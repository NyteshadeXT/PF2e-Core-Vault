The first irivyrns are said to have originated deep in the wilds of the realm of the fey. These majestic iridescent wyverns supposedly migrated to the Material Plane around the same time as gnomes, and the reasons for irivyrns' relocation are equally mysterious.

The typical irivyrn is coated with iridescent scales from head to tail, their obsidian-like smoothness diffracting light from every direction. The scales' glassy texture is particularly pronounced on an irivyrn's hindquarters, each serpentine undulation triggering a dazzlingly colorful display.

When angered, an irivyrn attacks first and foremost with its venomous tail stinger, which injects its victims with a deadly poison infused with the same magical iridescence as the dragon's shimmering scales. The iridescence in its venom is so concentrated that it can even blind subjects. Survivors of an irivyrn's attacks usually sport telltale rainbow-hued bruises around their eyes and their still-healing wounds.

## Irivyrn Offeings

Perhaps for vanity's sake, most irivyrns prefer solid-colored magic items and adornments as gifts, since varicolored objects tend to clash or compete with an irivyrn's iridescent scales. An irivyrn quickly dashes away anything incorporating a multitude of colors, no matter how valuable.
