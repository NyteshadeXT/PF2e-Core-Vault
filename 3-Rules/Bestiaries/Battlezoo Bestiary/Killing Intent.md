The mysterious entities called killing intents manifest on the Ethereal Plane when an especially violent mortal perishes on that plane and leaves a significant psychic impression on the planar landscape. A killing intent's presence is more often felt than perceived by sight or sound; witnesses report sudden drops in temperature, constant strong winds, and the extinguishment of lights. More terrifying, though, are counter-reports which suggest that these phenomena occur solely within the mind of a killing intent's victim.

Killing intents are attracted to fear, but they feed on pure bloodlust. When a killing intent locates a suitably strong host, it possesses the corporeal creature's body and goes on a murderous rampage to sate its hunger. Once its possession has run its course, or it runs out of victims to kill, a killing intent vacates its host and leaves the confused creature to deal with the bloody aftermath.

## The Pattern

Some fringe scholars theorize that killing intents are connected to "the pattern"â€”a mystical force that supposedly drives mortals to become "pattern killers." Such scholars do not claim that the killing intents are behind this mysterious force, but rather that these spirits are living stains left on the Ethereal Plane by the psyches of mortals affected by the pattern.
