    desc: "  The mind of a scroll mold is barely conscious and has difficulty imagining things it has not already perceived. As it has no sense of sight, visual illusions (such as those created by _[[Spells/Illusory Object|Illusory Object]]_) tend to appear as shifting, shapeless blobs. Auditory illusions (such as those created by _[[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]]_) tend to be distorted reflections of sounds the scroll mold has recently heard."

    desc: "  When using an innate spell, the scroll mold must expend 1 more action than that spell would usually require. However, it does not need to use somatic or verbal components, and the spell does not create obvious sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious to those nearby.\n\nThis ability obscures only the spell's casting, not its effects, so an observer would still see a gout of flame or an arc of lightning emitting from the scroll mold."

Many students of the arcane have muttered to themselves about a case of scrolls "wandering off on its own." Most of the time, they've simply misplaced the item. But now and again, when the conditions are right, their absurd ramblings are more right than they realize.

Scroll molds are colonies of color-shifting mold that have permeated and incorporated a decaying wooden scroll case into their masses, the scrolls within rendered slimy and blank. They are typically the result of magic scrolls left abandoned for too long in some musty basement or dank cavern. After extended exposure to the magic contained within the scroll case, a patch of otherwise ordinary mold develops strange new abilitiesâ€”and the beginnings of consciousness.

Scroll molds can barely move. Instead, they rely on their spells, camouflage, and distractions to stay safe. They generally hide in out-of-the-way spaces, preferably damp and dark nooks and crannies, tuning their color to blend in with their surroundings. If they sense approaching creatures, they instinctively create illusions to distract other creatures from their location. If still approached, a scroll mold will often try to put interlopers to sleep before casting _[[Tailwind|Longstrider]]_ to slither away to a new hiding place. As a last resort, the scroll mold can use its few offensive spells, although doing so makes it obvious it is not merely a decaying scroll case to be left alone to decompose.

## Hungry for Knowledge

Scroll molds have a particular taste for magic items. If a scroll mold senses magic and there is no one around, it might make its way over to the source and attempt to consume the item to incorporate it into itself. Utilizing this process, it can learn spells or develop powerful new abilities.
