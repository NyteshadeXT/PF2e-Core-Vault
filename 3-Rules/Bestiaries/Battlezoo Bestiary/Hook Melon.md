Hook melons are a strange and unsettling breed of fruit that dangle from the branches of their parent tree by a vine growing from their "neck." When fully ripe, they bear an uncanny resemblance to a headless humanoid body.

While most fruit disperses a plant's seeds by enticing other creatures into eating them, hook melons take a different approach. When intertwined with another creature's nervous system, the root-like fibers that trail from their torso allow the hook melon a limited amount of control over a creature's movements. They use this control to travel as far as possible from their parent tree and seek out a suitable place to sprout, often bludgeoning their unwilling host into unconsciousness or death in the process.

Hook melons possess a surprising degree of intelligence for a plant, considering the sophistication required to control another creature's body. Sometimes a group of hook melons (called a gallows) will cooperate to ambush larger groups of creatures, ensuring that at least one of their kind can escape while attached to a suitable host.

Occasionally, a hook melon will shun its biological drive and forgo sprouting in favor of further exploration. Such individuals have been known to disguise themselves with shapeless clothing in order to pass through inhabited areas.

Sightings of unusual centaur-like silhouettes lumbering across forests can sometimes be attributed to these macabre fruits.

## Selective Hosting

Though clearly plant-based life forms, hook melons possess eerie intellects, and their personalities are as alien to most humanoids as their invertebrate anatomy. Most hook melons prefer to attach to deer, large birds, and other swift-moving forest creatures, but for whatever reason, some instead have a predilection for humanoid bodies.
