With their small gray bodies, striped conical heads, tattooed flesh, and constantly wriggling head-tentacles, unravelers make their utterly alien nature known at first glance. These strange beings are messengers and scholars of entropy, an interest that typically makes them unexpected guests at best or destructive invaders at worst.

Unsurprisingly for a being of pure chaos, it can be difficult to predict an unraveler's actions and motives. At times, an unraveler might visit only to sate its curiosity via harmless observation or inquiry; other times, it might be delivering a message for powerful beings across planes or great distances; still other times, it might go about unraveling everything in its path for reasons other beings simply cannot fathom.

## Unraveled Art

Some unravelers use their powers to create great works of abstract art, partially unraveling objects and materials into beautiful arrangements. Such unravelers substitute Crafting for the Nature or Occultism skill and can cast a 4th-level [[Spells/Slow|Slow]] spell three times per day.
