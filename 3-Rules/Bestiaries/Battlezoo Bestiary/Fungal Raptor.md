To the untrained eye, a fungal raptor initially appears to be a disease-ridden avian skeleton. In fact, however, this unsightly creature is a naturally occurring airborne fungus that grows in the shape of a bird of prey.

Somehow, fungal raptors have gained enough intelligence to imitate the forms of their namesake flying predators. Packs of fungal raptors hunt dark forests and damp swamps, using their diseased wings to drive prey deeper into their territory by creating a maze of pestilence. Once a target is thoroughly disoriented and lost, the fungal raptors ambush their prey, infect their victim with a unique blood-devouring disease, and then retreat into the trees where they wait for their helpless victims to succumb to exsanguination. Like true carrion feeders, fungal raptors never eat live prey, but even more importantly, fresh blood itself is harmful to fungal raptors-a fact desperate defenders might try to use to their advantage.

Like most fungi, fungal raptors blossom and grow in dank, dimly lit areas such as dungeons, grottos, and ruins, making them a common threat to spelunkers and treasure-hunting adventurers. In addition, territorial druids sometimes purposefully cultivate fungal raptors to protect their primal demesnes.

## Spore Carriers

The first fungal raptors were created by a vampiric druid obsessed with the cycle of rot, decay, and rebirth (particularly the rot and decay parts). Since then, fungal raptors have spread throughout the known world utilizing sporal reproduction. Many woods- traipsing adventurers have unknowingly been sprinkled with the spores of a fungal raptor hiding in the trees above, only to carry the raptor's progeny far and wide.
