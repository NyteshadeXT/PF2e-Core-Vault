Wildfire leshies arise from the charred remains of plants destroyed by wildfires, and they are perhaps as often misunderstood as their terrifying—but wholly natural—conflagratory namesakes. Like wildfires themselves, wildfire leshies are part of the miraculous and mysterious cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

Similar to other leshies, wildfire leshies typically arise when a druid infuses a body of vegetation with a nature spirit, but spontaneously manifested wildfire leshies are far from unknown. Their small, stocky bodies are formed of tightly packed charred wood and twigs, and their sunken eyes and mouth resemble smoldering embers. Druids mesmerized by the power and beauty of fire find a good ally indeed in the form of a wildfire leshy, whose gentle heat can keep their friend warm at night and whose gravelly voice is not dissimilar to the sound of crackling firewood.

Wildfire leshies have an intuitive understanding of the natural balance in highly flammable natural areas such as forests and plains. Although wildfires are anathema to many animals and plants, certain kinds of life—including wildfire leshies themselves—rely on the natural cycle of fire, decay, and regrowth in order to flourish. Wildfire leshies use their preternatural knowledge of this cycle both to fight premature wildfires and to spark the first flames in areas overdue for a fiery cleansing. Whenever possible, wildfire leshies recruit the aid of other wild creatures, including other types of leshies, to usher vulnerable creatures toward a safe refuge before starting their inferno. Since they require little air to breathe and can see through even the thickest smoke with ease, wildfire leshies are also excellent at rescuing creatures caught in a wildfire before it's too late.

## Born of Fire

Wildfire leshies aren't the only such plant creatures to emerge from the ashes of a wildfire. Certain varieties of fungus leshies, for instance, can manifest only in the aftermath of a forest inferno, much like morel mushrooms.
