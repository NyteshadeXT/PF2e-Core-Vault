Few can look upon the face of a dryad husk and resist the pure fear it instills, and even fewer live to tell of it. Under normal circumstances, dryads are beautiful fey guardians of the forest. They become bound to great trees and rarely venture more than a few hundred feet from their homes. While the loss of its home tree can be devastating, a dryad can, in time, bind itself to a different tree.

The trouble arises, however, when calamity strikes a dryad's forest and yet fails to kill the dryad. Disease, fire, logging-these and other catastrophes can prevent an uprooted dryad from locating a suitable replacement for its lost home. Such dryads wander their destroyed homeland, wracked by pain for years. Over enough time, a treeless dryad can become a dryad husk-a shell of its former self, stuck in a state of perpetual agony, bent on inflicting the same pain on others that it feels every waking moment.

Dryad husks are driven by unbridled rage, particularly toward creatures they see as complicit in the destruction of forest land, which includes just about every kind of humanoid. In combat, they close with their enemies as soon as possible, forcing their foes to stare into their deformed faces in order to impart some of their anguish onto others. For a weapon, dryad husks often carry a corrupted or burned branch, the last remnant of the bound tree they lost.

From a distance, a dryad husk resembles its former self as a beautiful forest nymph. Up close, however, its horrifying visage becomes plain, as does its other monstrous features-skin as dry and cracked as dead logs, tangled hair matted with mud and slime.

## Other Husks

Dryads aren't the only nymphs capable of transforming into a husk-like abomination. Naiad husks appear to be made of fetid, murky water. Similarly, the husks of once- golden-hued hesperides resemble a twilight sky reflected through a shattered mirror.

## Husk

Plant creatures share a special bond with the natural world that few other beings can completely understand or appreciate. When the bond to its realm is broken or severed, a sentient plant creature's rage can transform it into a terrible shadow of its former self. Benign and even friendly plants like leshies, arboreals, and dryads all run the risk of this horrible metamorphosis, though their own agony often pales in comparison to the horrors which they inflict on their victims. Lonely, angry, and twisted, plant husks sow their monstrous madness in the fertile corpses of wanderers who dare travel through the husk's blighted swath of wilderness. Though in their eyes any living creature is worthy of obliteration, husks reserve their most horrendous punishments for any litterer, land settler, or lumberjack who ever dared to desecrate, dominate, or denude the forest.
