These constructed companions are designed to play an active role in magical research and experimentation. Around the lab, an automatic acolyte is a priceless assistant capable of casting nearly any basic spell from a magic item such as a scroll or wand. Though it cannot cast spells by itself, an automatic acolyte can be a veteran evoker, an expert diviner, a powerful enchanter, or any other type of master spellcaster-its limitations are dictated only by its load-out of magical apparatuses.

Though automatic acolytes fit well in certain churches where technology is part of the orthodoxy, these lanky constructs often wear large, heavy vestments to disguise their synthetic nature, if only to avoid putting off congregants.

## Sentience vs. Consciousness

Constructed companions are masters of conversation, organization, and entertainment, and they are often regarded as some of the most intellectual voices in the room. It is all the more impressive, then, to remember that these constructs were not created with the mind nor the soul of a sentient creature. Rather, their faculties are entirely the result of intricate programming and advanced algorithms instilled in them by their creators. Considering all this, one must ask: Does an automatic acolyte and its mechanical kin have a mind? If so, is it a living being? If not, then how does one explain its humanoid-like behavior? Consensus on these befuddling questions has eluded scholars, arcanists, and theologians for years.

## Constructed Companion

The automatic acolyte is one member of a family of constructs that could be playfully described as synthetic servants, constructed companions, or artificial allies. All these constructs are designed by extremely skilled engineers, artificers, and spellcasters from a variety of disciplines for the purpose of entertaining, serving, and protecting their living masters and associates. Though each of these creatures has its own special abilities, associated creatures, and typical demesne, the mechanical maître d', automatic acolyte, and bespoke bodyguard all share the same basic feature of being highly complex—some might even say "intelligent"—non-living creatures made of metal and wood.
