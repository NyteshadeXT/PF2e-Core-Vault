The most typical variety of salt stalker is called just that: a salt stalker. These individuals are the de facto hunters, scouts, and caretakers of their packs, and they find a great level of community among their kind. Salt stalkers regard their less-common kin—salt scorchers, stalk stalkers, and the terrifying salt mother—as overbearing but necessary elements to maintain the harmony of the pack.

An adult salt stalker resembles a greyhound crossed with a giant lizard, possessing rock-brown skin, double-jointed legs, and wicked claws. The salty bile they naturally secrete from their scaly, chitinous skin culminates in brittle, jagged "spines" that poke out from every part of their bodies. These spines break off easily, but also regrow rapidly. Although its primary means of offense are its wicked teeth and powerful jaws, a salt stalker can also forcibly eject its venom-loaded spines and ably aim them toward distant prey.

## Salt Stalker Roles

Different kinds of salt stalkers have evolved to fill different niches within their packs. A pack might include just one type of salt stalker or a mix of different types. The latter variety of pack tends to have a much more complicated social structure and power hierarchy, with different roles and even sub-roles for the different kinds of salt stalkers present. Regardless of the pack's complexity, though, few people could hope to understand the beasts' inscrutable social customs, mating dances, and their range of screeching yips and hair-raising calls, all of which strongly suggest a creature that is quite literally an alien to this world.

## Salt Stalker

Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.

Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.
