  - name: "Double Kick"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The osphranteal balances on its tail, then makes two foot Strikes against an enemy within reach. On a hit, the osphranteal automatically Shoves the target, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if its Strike was a critical hit). If the osphranteal moves to follow the target, its movement doesn't trigger reactions. The osphranteal's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after both Strikes are resolved. If both Strikes hit the same target, add up the damage before applying resistance or weakness, and add up the Shove distance. If the target is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or otherwise unable to move away from the osphranteal, the target isn't Shoved but it takes an additional 10 slashing from osphranteal's massive hind claws."

  - name: "Prodigious Leap"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The osphranteal Leaps up to 20 feet vertically or up to 40 feet horizontally. If the osphranteal spent its previous action to move at least 20 feet, these distances increase to 25 feet and 50 feet, respectively. At any point during the Leap, the osphranteal can make a foot Strike."

Osphranteals are majestic marsupials that roam the celestial plains of the plane of Nirvana. An osphranteal stands noble on fearsome hind legs, supported by a massive tail. Its upper torso is that of a muscular, deeply tanned humanoid, with a serene facial expression that belies the danger posed to evildoers by its powerful limbs.

Osphranteals cherish healthy growth and appreciate a selfless nature. They have strong protective feelings toward non-evil creatures smaller than themselves, whom they strive at all times to shelter from harm to the best of their ability.

During times of peace, highly ritualized brawling tournaments are an honored osphranteal pastime. In such tournaments, osphranteals duke it out among their own kind and with any other willing creatures deemed to be worthy challengers. There is no grand prize at stake, only the knowledge that the tourney's winner is the best suited individual to protect others—a status for which many osphranteals would fight tirelessly.

## Sworn Enemies

While osphranteals despise any kind of evil, they hold a special enmity toward daemons in general and meladaemons in particular, whom they seek to defeat at every opportunity. No one knows where the ancient grudge between osphranteals and meladaemons came from, though the daemons of starvation are only too happy to return their celestial counterparts' hatred.
