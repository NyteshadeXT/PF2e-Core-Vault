G'mayuns are avian humanoids that resemble colorful parrots and other birds native to tropical paradises. Yet for all their beauty and freedom, the great mythos of g'mayuns is studded with sorrow.

There are two sides to every coin-joy and sorrow, peace and violence. This is a universal truth that g'mayuns know all too intimately. Long ago, they led a life of harmony with the world, celebrating beauty in all its forms but especially drawn to song. Their patron deity, a goddess of art and love, filled their hearts with joyous inspiration, and song would fill the air in their treetop jungle homes. But no mortal light nor any form of beauty is entirely safe from the jealous clutches of demonkind.

Corruption was slow and subtle. Demons in disguise made their way into g'mayun enclaves and began to spread their corruptive influence. Slowly, the brilliant light of g'mayuns dimmed, and voices that once lifted in celebration cried out to the darkness in rage. It seemed they were on the edge of being forever lost, another people damned to the status of monsters.

However, miracles happen, even to the most unexpected people and in the most unexpected places, and the g'mayun patron goddess wasn't willing to allow her former devotees to lose themselves completely. As subtly as the corruption spread among g'mayun culture, their patron's redemption was overt, a powerful love extending into their song and offering the hand they needed to pull them back from the brink.

Now, g'mayuns are a people with souls rent between the demonic corruption, now centuries gone but still leaving scars upon their song, and the rainbow, both ancient and new, that slowly soothes them and undoes the sins of the past, generation by generation. But as ever, there are songs in their hearts-songs that, these days, speak to this harsh dichotomy. The loveliest of melodies, expressing the deepest of anguish and anger. Joy and love screamed in bitter anthems. Releasing all malevolence still within their hearts with music and art rather than succumbing to the temptations of wrath.

## Incongruous Attire

The g'mayun resemble small and intensely colored humanoid birds without wings. Their feathers range over a broad and bright spectrum. These feathers grow the longest and brightest atop their heads, often standing high into the air or cascading down their backs. Their large and expressive eyes are likewise a swirl of color. This vivid appearance is often offset by their taste for the darkest of clothing, adorned with skulls, spikes, or other elements that are usually more expected of nefarious cults.
