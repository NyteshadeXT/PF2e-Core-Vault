A corpsesewn colossus is a nightmarish machine of flesh and steel, animated from the bones and flesh of untold masses and powered by a nightmarish engine of iron and steel. The horrific construct's body is sutured skin and twitching limbs that terminate in an enormous maw filled with clanking metal teeth, while two massive arms pull the behemoth along. While it may initially seem animated by necromantic powers or undead magic, the corpsesewn colossus is actually powered by a massive, rumbling, smog-spewing machine attached to the back of its worm-like body.

Though their missions vary by the crafter, corpsesewn colossi tend not to have a much greater purpose than to scour the land in search of ever more bodies to consume in order to fuel their own hellish engine. In this way, they are perpetual murder machines: powered by death only so that they may inflict yet more death. Despite this, corpsesewn colossi are sometimes tasked with searching mass burial grounds or fields of war for specific corpses, such as notable commanders or heroes. When so commanded, a colossus will dutifully shovel this body into a special compartment in order to bring it back, as whole as possible, to its master.

## Crafted Under a Banner of Cruelty

Corpsesewn colossi are typically created by deranged alchemists and wizards, and often only by those innovators who have already mastered the art of smaller such monstrosities like flesh golems and skinstitches. Still, it takes a special mind to craft (or to even concoct in the first place) this particular brand of horror. Perhaps, then, it only makes sense that corpsesewn colossi are more common in war-torn nations, where scruples tend to be as scant as corpses are prevalent.
