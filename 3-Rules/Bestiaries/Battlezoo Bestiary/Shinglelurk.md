    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The shinglelurk has one or more creatures [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]];\n\n**Effect** The shinglelurk flies up to triple its fly Speed, then purposefully falls, letting gravity slam its body and prey into the ground below. The shinglelurk and each grabbed creature take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen (for example, 10 bludgeoning damage for 20 feet fallen). The grab ends and each creature lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in the nearest empty square."

  - name: "Envelop"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (attack) The shinglelurk makes an attack roll with a +16 bonus against the Reflex DC of up to three Medium or smaller creatures that are adjacent to or on top of the shinglelurk. This attack is automatically successful against creatures who are already [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. On a success, the shinglelurk envelops the creature, who is grabbed and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].\n\nThe shinglelurk can envelop up to 3 Medium or smaller creatures at a time. Attacks that hit the shinglelurk split damage evenly between the shinglelurk and the enveloped creatures. The shinglelurk's flying speed is reduced by 10 feet per creature enveloped. When the shinglelurk moves, it moves enveloped creatures with it."

  - name: "Mimic Surface"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The shinglelurk flattens its body so it is flush with a hard flat surface such as a rooftop. While flattened, the shinglelurk has an automatic result of 30 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as the surface that it's mimicking. As long as it is flattened, a shinglelurk can share its space with any creatures that walk on top of it."

The bane of roof runners, cat burglars, and sneak thieves in metropolises the world over, shinglelurks are simpleminded nocturnal hunters that have adapted to the spread of urban cityscapes. Wide, heavy, and thin, a shinglelurk's tough, rubbery body blends seamlessly with common roofing materials such as stone, slate, and tile. Shinglelurks wait on such roofs for unsuspecting prey to traipse over them, then strike with deadly speed and efficiency.

The first shinglelurks were created by spellcasting urbanites who sought to devise a camouflaged solution for home defense. These wizards experimented on cloakers, mimics, and ochre jellies to create their ideal monstrous defender. In the process, they released untold numbers of specimens into the city before ultimately creating the hybrid known as the shinglelurk.

Occasionally, a bold landowner might lure a shinglelurk onto their property with the hopes the creature will take up residence. Without magical coercion, such landowners find the erratic-minded shinglelurk an unreliable partner. Thankfully, a shinglelurk tends to leave its hunting ground once it has devoured a burglar or two or otherwise compromised its hiding spot.

## Last Ditch Dive

Shinglelurks have strong self-preservation instincts, matched only by their dedication to the kill. If a shinglelurk has one or more creatures enveloped in its body, it might risk injury by intentionally falling off a roof or other high place and smashing into the street below, relying on its tough, spongy hide to survive the impact while disabling its prey.

## Solitary Reproduction

Shinglelurks are solitary and territorial monsters, and their violent disposition extends to members of their own kind as well. They do not form bonds or even mate. Rather, upon reaching a certain age and size, a shinglelurk will molt and bud, producing two offspring before dying. The offspring quickly grow to adulthood and strike out on their own, repeating the cycle.
