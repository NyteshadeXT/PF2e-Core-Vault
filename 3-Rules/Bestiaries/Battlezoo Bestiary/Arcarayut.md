As far as an arcarayut is concerned, what goes up must also come down. Charged with protecting and enforcing the laws of gravity, arcarayuts are the bane of those who depend too much on magical flight, levitation, or even just magical protections from long falls. Thankfully for most abjurers and transmuters, arcarayuts focus their efforts only on the multiverse's most flagrant or powerful abusers of such gravity-defying powers, such as proteans who warp the laws of gravity across an entire plane or arcanists who levitate entire nations.

An aracarayut looks like a fist-sized filigreed diamond. Two marbles-one jet black, one bone white-float around the diamond and are vital to the creature's gravitational balance. While ruthless in punishing those that defy gravity magically, arcarayuts are fascinated by creatures that can glide and fly through physical means. When not pursuing quarry, they can often be found watching birds and other winged creatures soar for hours on end.

Arcarayuts are more inclined to pursue knowledge than most inevitables. They engage in numerous practical experiments and mundane studies regarding the effects of gravity on items of various sizes, shapes, and materials. Because they are constantly coming up with new experiments, most arcarayuts keep a wide variety of trinkets and baubles in their small gravity fields. An arcarayut has enough control over its gravitational field that it can use items in its debris field as weapons at close range and strike targets farther away with pulses of concentrated gravity

## Valuable Inevitable

When an arcarayut is destroyed, its diamond center turns gray and dull and falls lifelessly to the ground. This crystal can be dissolved in protean blood to create 1d6 doses of [[Oil of Weightlessness (Greater)|Oil of Weightlessness (Greater)]] or a single dose of [[Oil of Repulsion|Oil of Repulsion]]. This fact, in addition to the countless treasures that often float around arcarayuts, makes these inevitables valuable targets for plane-hopping treasure hunters.
