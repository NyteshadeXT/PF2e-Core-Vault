Finally, smoke billows from the burning veenlijk in a 10-foot emanation; all creatures in the smoke are concealed, and all other creatures are concealed to them."

A veenlijk comes into being when a humanoid is strangled to death and its corpse is disposed of in a swamp. The victim's spirit, which is too anguished to move on, and its body, preserved by the swamp's acids, harden into an undead creature whose sole motive is to haunt its sodden domain.

Some veenlijken are the result of murder or foul play, while others rise in the wake of sacrificial rites to swamp-dwelling gods and other occult powers. When the veenlijk rises, it may at first seek to avenge its death, hunting down anyone it deems complicit in its terrible fate. Dim-witted by death, however, most veenlijken end up indiscriminately targeting anyone who happens to cross their path. Particularly old or cunning veenlijken purposefully set up environmental traps, using magic to conceal quicksand and other hazards that might aid in their ambushes.

The most sinister veenlijken truly embrace their undeath, believing themselves destined to be the unholy protectors of their boggy demesnes. Such a veenlijk might lead its own elaborate rituals centered on human sacrificeâ€”unholy rites modeled after its own undead genesis.

## Druids and Veenlijken

Certain bog-dwelling druids reverentially tell stories of "primordial veenlijken," whom they regard as supernatural manifestations of the cycle of life and death in a swamp. The most ardent devotees of such radical beliefs dwell on the outskirts of veenlijken hunting grounds, luring travelers and adventurers into the swamp and personally abetting the primordial veenlijk's wicked ceremonies.
