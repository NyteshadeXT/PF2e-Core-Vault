The spellcaster can prepare one additional spell of the highest level for which they have spell slots.

The possessed text has the same statistics and abilities as the ghostwriter.

Ghostwriters are undead spirits that possess and revise texts in a misguided attempt to improve upon writings or to trick living spellcasters and researchers into unwittingly utilizing the spirit's work.

A ghostwriter typically rises from the spirit of an avid scholar or arcanist who labored endlessly but fruitlessly on a long-winded historical treatise or arcane thesis. Risen as a ghostwriter, this unswerving intellectual aims its creative energies at the writings of the living. Ghostwriters typically hide within spellbooks, twisting words and tweaking language in ways that can cause a wizard's spells to flourish or fizzle.

## Stubborn Ego

Ghostwriters are easily offended by critics or readers that seem ungrateful for the spirit's attempts to improve their spells and documents; flattery is a far more fruitful tack. Though difficult, if one can convince a ghostwriter that their work is finished, the spirit can finally drift to the afterlife.
