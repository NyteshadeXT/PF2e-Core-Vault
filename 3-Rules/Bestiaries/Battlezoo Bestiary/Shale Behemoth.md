    desc: "`pf2:2` (sonic) The shale behemoth flings a sonically resonant crystal shard from its back, making three crystal shard Strikes against one to three creatures within 120 feet. Its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all three attacks.\nRegardless of whether or not a shard hits, each shard lands in the space of the targeted creature and begins to violently hum as a supersonic shockwave vibrates through it. A creature that begins its turn adjacent to a shard must succeed at a Fortitude save or become Clumsy 2 for 1 round.\nOn the shale behemoth's next turn, each shard explodes in a cacophonous burst of sharp crystals, dealing 3d10 sonic damage and 3d10 piercing damage to creatures in a 10-foot emanation (basic Reflex save)."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,sonic) The shale behemoth rubs its crystalline joints against the ground or a nearby wall, causing a deafening squeal of mineral on rock, dealing 1d4 rounds.\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and is Clumsy 1 for 1 round.\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is Deafened for 24 hours, and is Stunned 1.\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is permanently deafened, and is Stunned 2."

The most venerable of all shale spitters are called shale behemoths. These mountainous monstrosities resemble quaking mounds of chitinous plating, sedimentary rock, and mineral formations. Countless crystalline structures and gemstone deposits pock the ancient being's carapace, creating a constellation of dazzling jewels that range from common quartz to lustrous diamond. Their massive size means shale behemoths confine themselves to only the largest underground caverns. When it must relocate, a behemoth's lumbering journey shakes the entire mountain in which it dwells.

## Priceless Carapace

A shale behemoth's body is covered in a dragon's horde worth of rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other gemstones. Mysteriously, many shale behemoths grow not only mundane minerals and gems on their carapaces, but also alchemical and magical stone items such as thunderstones, _elemental gems_, and even powerful _crystal balls_.

In addition to the mundane gems and the magical items that protrude from a shale behemoth's body, this gentle giant grows a unique form of acoustically sensitive crystal that can generate and amplify deafening sonic signals. A shale behemoth won't usually go out of its way to attack smaller creatures, but when threatened, the animal can use its resonant crystals to generate bone-shaking shockwaves and eardrum-rupturing reverberations.

## Shale Spitter

Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselvesâ€”looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.
