At first glance, obsidian shale beasts look more like walking mounds of knives than living creatures. But these strange grasshopper-like beings do share the same lineage as common shale spitters; their stony exteriors have simply morphed from many years of consuming and digesting brittle, vitreous minerals and rocks such as quartz, calcite, and obsidian.

When encountered on their own, obsidian shale beasts are typically found much deeper underground than most shale spitters. They have a particular fondness for veins of molten rock, and are more prevalent in mountains with active volcanoes, where searing heat and incredible pressure hone their bodies into jagged weapons. Old obsidian shale beasts who have spent decades or even centuries near lava flows or magma veins can grow to incredible sizes and develop brutally sharp, extra-dense carapaces.

Owing to their brittle and oblong bodies, obsidian shale beasts cannot curl up into protective balls like most shale spitters. Rather, obsidian shale beasts rely on their natural armor, which is as brittle and sharp as an obsidian blade, to protect them from inter-pack tussles, attacks from predators, and sudden cave-ins.

## Noble "Bards"

A shale spitter pack with an obsidian shale beast among their numbers is far more likely to survive times of crisis. When an unmatchable predator like a cavern troll or cave worm attacks the pack, it's up to the obsidian shale beast to rally its kin to safety while fending off the intruder. The shale beast accomplishes this with its unique ability to produce a subsonic hum that snaps other shale spitters out of torpors and drives them to action. Shale beasts are also unusually noble, and will stay behind to distract an attacker if doing so will enable its pack mates to escape.

## Shale Spitter

Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselvesâ€”looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.
