A creature of quiet, gleeful malice, the muted delver is a gigantic monstrosity that stalks the loneliest corners of the deepest seas. It climbs aboard ships and glides across the decks, silent as a shadow, so that it can devour the crew one by one and drive any survivors mad. Its form is so monstrous and its tactics so alien that reports of muted delvers are almost universally dismissed as tall tales.

Though muted delvers tend to haunt deep oceanic waters and the ships of those who ply them, they do sometimes venture ashore as well, where they lurk beneath slippery docks and outside derelict boathouses. In either case, their depredations are always of a subdued, haunting variety, never loud or chaotic. Nobody is quite sure how muted delvers manage to consume their prey, owing to their sealed lips, and yet they do, as evidenced by the piles of meticulously cleaned bones they leave in their wake.

In addition to their command over the primal magic of the sea, these maritime monstrosities have evolved several unusual hunting tools. They have two small nozzles next to their eyes, from which they fire deadly jets of pressurized air that pierce victims from a distance. In addition, a terrible claw dangling from its lure makes nabbing or slashing prey a simple affair.

## Delver Flunkies

Particularly gluttonous muted delvers sometimes gather mobs of less powerful aquatic abominations—skum, sea devils, and even chuuls—to assist with their sadistic endeavors. Though they have a tendency to obsess over visually stimulating phenomena, including shiny gems and reflective trinkets, muted delvers have little love for dull or uninteresting valuables, prizes that keep their minions at least somewhat loyal.
