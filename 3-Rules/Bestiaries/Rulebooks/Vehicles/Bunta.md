    desc: "`pf2:3`  **Activate** `pf2:T` command, envision, Interact\n**Requirements** You are piloting Bunta\n**Effect** A silver river flows from your heart, traveling forward in a line that flows around obstacles as if it were water. If _Bunta_ travels at least its speed along the river each round for 10 minutes, you arrive at another plane as if you cast [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]]. You arrive in a destination you specify, or a random location if you don't have a choice. If _Bunta_ ever does not travel at least its Speed in a round, you can disrupt this activation. If you continue, you have a 1% cumulative chance of ending up in a random extraplanar location for each round that _Bunt_a did not travel at least its Speed, to a maximum of a 60% chance if _Bunta_ didn't travel at least its Speed for the full 10 minutes. As long as you remain on _Bunta_, you are protected from any harmful effects of the plane's environment."
