Neither human nor beast yet resembling both, yeongno (yeong-no) are creatures that once were denizens of heaven but were cast out, down to the mortal Universe, due to their own greed. Yeongno claim to have once been celestial dragons and wear elongated dragon masks with full-body wraps decorated with scale patterns in honor of this claimâ€”though no one has been able to confirm the veracity of this belief. As they wander, they hold a willow pipe in their mouths, producing a distinct "bibi" sound that often heralds their appearance.

Despite their reputation as monsters who eat people, yeongno are welcomed by the poor and oppressed, who see the creatures as wise and just. Yeongno believe that by eating 100 wealthy individuals who abuse their wealth or who accumulated their wealth by underhanded or exploitative means, they can atone for their own greed, allowing them to ascend back into heaven. A corrupt and greedy individual can escape their fate of being eaten by a yeongno by giving away all of their wealth and agreeing to be transformed into a pig for one year. If the person can endure one year living as a pig in the care of a household they once harmed, the yeongno will spare them.
