Rift chameleons are best known for their unsettling ability to swallow creatures significantly larger than themselves, thanks to a digestive tract that connects to its own pocket of the Ethereal Plane. When two or more rift chameleons remain in proximity for extended periods of time, their partially extradimensional nature begins to subtly warp the surrounding terrain. Direction and distance become confused to all but the lizards, making it easy for locals to get lost in places they once thought familiar.
