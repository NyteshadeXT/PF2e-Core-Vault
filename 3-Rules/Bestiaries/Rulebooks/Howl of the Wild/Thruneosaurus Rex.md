The unholy terror known as the thruneosaurus rex is not a natural beast. They were created by Chelaxian diabolists who sought to combine the ferocity of dinosaurs with the power of Hell, infusing a clutch of tyrannosaurus rex eggs from Mediogalti Island with devil ichor and naming the monstrous hatchlings after their patrons. Although few records and fewer survivors tell exactly how the experiment went awry, the experimental subjects escaped, and their descendants are now most often sighted in the Whisperwood in eastern Cheliax.
