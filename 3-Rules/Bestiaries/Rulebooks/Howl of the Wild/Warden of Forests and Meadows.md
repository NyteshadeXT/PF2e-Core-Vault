  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Warden of the Wild) Voice of Nature|Voice of Nature]]"
    desc: "  Though the Wardens of the Wild do not speak in words, they can communicate complex concepts flawlessly and wordlessly with any animal, beast, plant, or other creature of the natural world through prolonged eye contact. Sapient creatures with strong ties to the natural world, such as animal instinct barbarians or druids who speak the Wildsong, can somewhat understand a Warden of the Wild, though the meaning can be vague."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Warden of the Wild) Warden's Crown|Warden's Crown]]"
    desc: "  A Warden of the Wild's horned crown commands respect from wild creatures. Wild creatures native to a warden's biome automatically improve their attitude toward it by one step (up to friendly) and typically do not take hostile actions towards each other while in the warden's presence."

If it fails, the warden redirects the ability to target a different creature in range with a burst of mental laughter; this has no effect if there are no other eligible targets. The triggering creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours unless it critically failed."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,mental,primal) The warden grants a boon to a willing creature he can see other than himself, requesting that the creature promise to use the granted power to destroy or undermine the creations of civilization. The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +5 status bonus to damage against constructs, objects, and structures constructed by humanoids. It also gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks against humanoids. The warden can have only one wager granted at a time. The wager ends if the target is captured or dies.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Fox's Wager|Effect: Fox's Wager]]"

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,primal) **Frequency** once per hour\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The warden creates an area of peaceful calm. This is identical to a 5th-rank [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]] depicting a peaceful meadow or forest, except the area is a @Template[burst|distance:200].\n\nWhile within the area of an Idyllic Panorama, the warden has significant control over the senses of creatures within the area and can cast [[Spells/Mislead|Mislead]] and 2nd-rank [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] at will."
