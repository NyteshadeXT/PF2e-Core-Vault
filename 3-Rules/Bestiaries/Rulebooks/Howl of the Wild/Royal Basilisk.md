    desc: "  The royal basilisk's crown is firmly attached to its head but can be [[Actions/Disarm|Disarmed]] as though it were a held item. Without a crown, the royal basilisk's mastery over poison is weakened enough that it loses its miasmatic shroud. The royal basilisk can equip a crown within its tail's reach as an Interact action. A royal basilisk's crown is normally made of iron and enables the basilisk to use miasmatic shroud, but crowns made of other, more exotic materials might confer different abilities."

The royal basilisk is aptly named, not for only the metal crown upon its head but also for the unique potency of its poison. The creature's poison manifests as a sort of cloying vapor that sticks onto and eats away at anything it touches. Their mastery of poison does appear to come at a cost, as the royal basilisk has no ability to petrify its prey. Although the royal basilisk can painstakingly shape a crown, some made of simple iron and others of rare skymetals, they much prefer to collect crowns crafted by other creatures.
