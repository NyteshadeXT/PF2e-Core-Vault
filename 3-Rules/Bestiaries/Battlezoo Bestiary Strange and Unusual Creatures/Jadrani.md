A jadrani is a giant undead bird formed from a slain and corrupted phoenix. Jadrani lair in dark caves and sleep in mountains of corpses of those foolhardy enough to seek their so-called fountain of youth, not knowing the true source of this myth. The withering and rejuvenation of a jadrani mark a contradiction in its nature. Where its aura is said to reverse the aging of living creatures, its very being is an affront to life itself. Jadrani use these tales for their own vile ends, sometimes even allowing petitioners to live to spread their legend and attract additional fools to their lair. Unlike a phoenix's song, this creature's song soothes no hearts.

Should one of an jadrani's hunters manage to slay it, the jadrani's cursed flesh and bones turn to dust and coalesce around its killer in a deadly curse. It helps itself to a banquet of their life force and emerges from their flesh and bones only seconds later, often felling them instantly and adding another corpse to the pile.

## Extinguished Hope

Necromantic magic and acts of evil are not sufficient to transform a phoenix into a jadrani. Phoenixes are beacons of kindness and hope. Foes must snuff out those qualities entirely, driving a phoenix into despair, before they can corrupt the creature. While such an end is tragic, it does bear the silver lining that jadrani are reclusiveâ€”they do not actively go out into the world to spread destruction in the same way that phoenixes travel widely to heal and console.
