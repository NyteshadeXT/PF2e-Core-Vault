    desc: "`pf2:2` (extradimensional,incapacitation,occult,teleportation) The sorrow portrait transports a creature into a painted world where it becomes the subject of the horrors it depicts. The sorrow portrait can target a creature within 30 feet, and the target must succeed a DC 33 Will check save or be transported into an extradimensional space within the sorrow portrait and become the subject of the painting. Failing the Will save and being sucked into the painting has the effects of the _[[Spells/Quandary|Maze]]_ spell on the unfortunate victim, except for the following differences:\n\n*   The sorrow portrait doesn't need to Sustain the effect.\n*   The victim can also attempt to escape the painting by attempting a check relevant to what the sorrow portrait depicts, as determined by the GM (such as Athletics check to Swim from a shipwreck, or a Strike to fend off wolves).\n*   At the end of its turn, if the subject is still within the sorrow portrait, it takes 5d6 mental damage with a DC 29 Will check save. The damage type and save type might change to suit the sorrow portrait's depiction, as determined by the GM. If the sorrow portrait is destroyed, the effect ends immediately.\n*   The sorrow portrait can only have one subject inside of it at one time, and if the subject escapes it becomes immune to that sorrow portrait's Subject of Horror for 1 minute.\n*   If the subject dies within the painted world, any attempt to resurrect the subject must succeed at a DC 15 Flat check if the painting is still intact, or the resurrection magic fails."

Said to be created from paint mixed with the blood of a still-living victim, sorrow portraits are magical paintings that can trap other creatures within their artificial painted world. Sadistic manor owners favor the use of sorrow portraits, as they provide two benefits at once: they decorate the mansion with a certain horrific aesthetic, and they provide protection to the dwelling from potential intruders or other undesirables. Appearing as large paintings, sorrow portraits always depict some form of tragedy, but they lack a central humanoid subject.

Sorrow portraits typically spend most of their time dormant, impersonating a regular, albeit macabre, painting. However, when a sorrow portrait detects an unwelcome intruder, it suddenly flies from its placement and attempts to transport that intruder into the twisted realm within the painting. Once its new subject is trapped, the sorrow portrait attempts to flee from any other would-be assailant so that the soul of its newly painted victim remains imprisoned forever.

## Haunting Art

Anyone whose blood contributed to a sorrow portrait has part of their essence tied to the painting. When they die, they become a ghost who haunts the scenes painted with their blood. These ghosts cannot leave the painting, but they can speak to warn potential victims. The ghost can also aid or hinder a subject's escape attempt.
