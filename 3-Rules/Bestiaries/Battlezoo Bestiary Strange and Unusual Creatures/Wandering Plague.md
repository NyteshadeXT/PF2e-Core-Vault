If the Strike hits, the creature's carnivorous plague's stage is reduced by one, and the wandering plague becomes Large for 1 minute, increasing its reach by 5 feet, and regaining 4d8 + 10 Hit Points. If the wandering plague is already Large due to a previous use of this ability, it instead becomes Huge for 1 minute. In that case, it increases its reach by 10 feet instead of 5, and regains 6d8 + 15 Hit Points instead of 4d8+10 Hit Points."

  - name: "Pestilent Assault"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult) Violently thrashing at its target, the wandering plague hastens the progress of its infectious reproduction by leaving behind loose lumps of its own flesh. The wandering plague Strides once, then makes a pseudopod Strike against a creature within its reach. On a hit, if the creature is already afflicted by carnivorous plague, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the disease as if enough time had passed for it to progress to its next stage."

The result of abhorrent occult experiments, the wandering plague is a predatory scourge that replicates itself by infecting living organisms with its festering touch. Once a living creature becomes host to the carnivorous disease borne by these creatures, its vitality degrades as it is slowly digested from within by the nascent wandering plague. Upon becoming fully grown, the entity bursts out of its former host, killing it, and burrows deep, seeking others of its kind.

This interwoven mass of bloodstained fat and sinew is capable of ravaging entire nations if left unchecked. While most scholars believe the spread of this living sickness could indeed pose a grave threat, certain eldritch tomes suggest even grimmer connections, alluding to ancient beings dwelling at the edge of reality whose hunger is only rivaled by their callous, unrelenting cruelty.

## In Remission

When a wandering plague senses others of its kind being killed nearby, it may go into hibernation either underground or within a deep cave. During this time, it shrinks to a small size and slows down its metabolism to the point that most spells can't detect its presence as a living creature. It can stay in this state nearly indefinitely, but will quickly spring back to full alertness if it comes into contact with a potential host, ready to begin its spread again.
