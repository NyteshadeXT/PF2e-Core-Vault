The wyrm gains temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature takes from the Breath Weapon; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. These temporary Hit Points last 1 minute.\n*   **Nebula** (arcane, evocation, fire, positive) The wyrm breathes the primordial stuff of proto-stars in a 50-foot cone that deals 20d6 fire damage (DC 42 Reflex check save) to the wyrm's foes in the area, or positive damage to undead foes, whichever is worse for each undead foe. The wyrm's allies in the area instead heal half as many Hit Points."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The star wyrm shares its cosmic energy with an ally that doesn't have the Celestial Attunement ability within 30 feet.

Star wyrms are beings similar to true dragons that live in the vacuum of space. They appear as countless motes of light that gather into the shape of a dragon. Intensely social creatures, their social groups—called constellations—are metaphysically connected. They are almost never found alone and occasionally ally with other kinds of creatures.

As a loose collection of smaller elements, star wyrms are greatly harmed by foes who disrupt their integrity with precise strikes at their component stars.

## Fusion Cuisine

The star wyrm's digestion process resembles the processing of raw materials in the hearts of stars. The results are an alchemist's dream come true, with organic material transforming into metals and base metals turning into precious ones. A star wyrm's conception of treasure revolves around philosophical concepts, for otherwise their latrines would be their hoards.
