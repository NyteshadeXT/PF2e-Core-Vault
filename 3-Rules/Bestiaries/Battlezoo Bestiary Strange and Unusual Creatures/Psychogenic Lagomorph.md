A psychogenic lagomorph looks like a common forest-dwelling rabbit with long ears and a cottony tail that hovers above the ground, surrounded by a protective bubble. These unusual creatures have enhanced psychic and mental abilities of unknown origin and a startling intellect, albeit one that other sapient creatures have difficulty understanding.

It would be a fatal mistake to underestimate these cute, fluffy creatures. Where common rabbits flee from danger, psychogenic lagomorphs are quick to defend themselves with their psychic abilities. They summon a protective barrier to shield themselves from attacks while they frantically throw nearby objects using telekinesis. Their assailants often find themselves pelted with branches and stones.

Something in their subconscious nature drives psychogenic lagomorphs to seek out and hoard copper coins above all other treasure. This could somehow be related to the secrets of their origin, or it could just be a baffling side effect of their strange mutations. They store any coins they find in an extradimensional pocket accessed through their mouths. These coins can be used as telekinetic ammunition. So far, psychogenic lagomorphs have not been observed possessing or using any copper that isn't in coin form.
