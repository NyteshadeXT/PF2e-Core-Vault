    desc: "  A salirus's swarm is part of its true self. After defeating a salirus, its swarm disperses, and 2d4 days later, one of the constituent creatures grows into a new salirus if even a single one escapes. While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the salirus's foes have to dispatch the [[undefined]] creatures before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the salirus collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 Flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the creatures escapes, and the salirus is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the salirus."

Many see nothing but stagnation in swamps. As nature's bog guards, saliruses know different. They see the decay and rot as nature's way of reclaiming what is no longer needed and know that life thrives just beneath the murky surface of the water. Like their brethren in other terrains, these fey creatures have a close connection to their swamps and punish anyone who would pollute their territory.

A salirus can move unfettered through their natural environment, unimpeded by underbrush, and can walk across water as easily as land. They use this to their advantage, ambushing opponents when their targets are hampered by either water or plants and using their maneuverability to keep their distance.

A salirus has the appearance of a humanoid beetle, complete with compound eyes, wicked mandibles, and a soft but obvious carapace. Its body ends at its torso, though, and six long, insectile legs spring from its waist. Each leg ends in a splayed-toed, webbed foot.

The salirus is constantly surrounded by a cloud of fireflies that flash in a rainbow of colors. As with all iruses, this swarm is actually a part of the salirus, and the salirus can control it as easily as any other part of its body. In fact, should a salirus's main body be destroyed, one of these fireflies becomes the repository of its consciousness and slowly grows into a duplicate of the destroyed body. Only by completely destroying this swarm of fireflies that make up a salirus's extended body can a salirus be truly slain.

* * *

Iruses are a family of fey creatures who find beauty in remote places most humanoids and other mortal folk overlook. Unfortunately for those who pass through their domains, they assume anyone in their territory is there to despoil it and react violently.

Each irus is made up of a main body and a swarm of smaller bodies, each with a different physical shape. Both body and swarm are a single creature, however, and an irus can control the smaller bodies as easily as an arm or leg. Should the main body be destroyed, one of the smaller creatures will slowly grow into a new main body.

There is some evidence that all iruses are actually the same species adapted to different environments. For example, a swarm body from one type of irus can cleave off and form a new main body of a different type if it encounters the correct environment.

## Salirus And Wisps

Occasionally, a salirus teams up with will-o'-wisps to lead a more dangerous group of adventurers astray in their swampy home. The wisps and the salirus intersperse the salirus's colorful fireflies with the wisps' dancing lights to completely befuddle, ambush, and then terrorize their opponents.

## Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey And Analysis Of The Field

The metaphysical process of swarm rejuvenation is complicated, and among the scholars who sought to understand it, many died to irus attacks before one extremely persistent researcher managed to publish a treatise named Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey and Analysis of the Field, which is currently recognized as the most prominent collection of theories and data on the subject.

According to the text, when an irus's central body is defeated, it spreads the primal energy of its fey self throughout the swarm of creatures that make up its extended body. Each of these creatures is connected to the others and the main body by an invisible web of magical links, similar to arteries or a ley line network, and the web persists after the body's death.

This means that no matter how many of the swarm's constituents are killed, the irus can quickly shift their energy into whichever manages to survive. However, the transfer isn't lossless, and an unpredictable amount of the essence spills out during the process, especially if many of the swarm's constituent creatures also perish. This leads to a significant variation in how long it takes for the irus to rejuvenate, as the more energy it loses, the longer it takes to return.
