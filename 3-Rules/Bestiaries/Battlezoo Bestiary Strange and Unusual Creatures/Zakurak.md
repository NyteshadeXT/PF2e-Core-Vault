The sahkil tormentor Zakurak is the manifestation of mortals' fear of dragons, as well as the terrifying draconic presence possessed by true dragons. A massive blend of dragon, skeleton, and arachnid, Zakurak often travels from the Ethereal Plane to the Dreamlands to infect the minds of ancient dragons, promising them power in exchange for spreading terror.
