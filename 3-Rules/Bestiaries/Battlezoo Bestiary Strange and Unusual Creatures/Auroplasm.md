Auroplasms are mystical marauders of sentient gold that lust for one thing above all others: more gold to add to their bodies. Each one has a main denomination, which they use as their face. If they absorb a significant quantity of a different coinage, they split off a new auroplasm to resolve the internal conflict. You can simulate a newly split auroplasm by making it Small and giving it the weak template, or an engorged one just before splitting by applying the effects of enlarge.

As beings composed entirely of gold, auroplasms face both dragons and adventurers as natural predators. But they themselves also hunt dragons for their hoards. Since they don't care for most other treasures, they sometimes team up with adventurers, but adventurers with significant gold reserves should watch their backs.

## Auroplasm Origins

According to legend, auroplasms originate from a single incident, when a powerful sorcerer was caught standing on a dragon's hoard and boiled alive in molten gold until his fire resistance spells gave out. His fury, frustration and greed fused with the hoard and created the first auroplasm.
