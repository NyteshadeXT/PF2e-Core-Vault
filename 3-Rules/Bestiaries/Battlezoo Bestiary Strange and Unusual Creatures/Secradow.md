    desc: "  The secradow can use its Secret Lore not just to know information about the secret that spawned it, but also to know other information known to the creature keeping the secret who spawned the secradow. It gains a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate that creature."

  - name: "Exposure Sense"
    desc: "  A secradow can sense the direction of the nearest creature or object that holds knowledge or evidence of its associated secret as long as it's on the same plane. It can always sense whether or not such a creature or object exists."

  - name: "Never Show"
    desc: " (auditory,illusion,occult,visual) A secradow shrouds itself in an illusion of invulnerability and perfect health. The secradow appears to be somehow unaffected by any attack or effect used against it, even though it's still being hurt just as badly as normal. The first time each round a creature physically interacts with a secradow they must attempt a DC 30 Will check saving throw. Creatures that have been affected by never show in the last 24 hours gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their save. On a success, they realize the truth and see that the secradow has been harmed by the attacks against it all along."

    desc: "  Whenever someone with a connection to the secradow's secret (determined by the GM, but this generally includes people affected by the secret directly or those who know enough about the topic to be curious of the details) discovers the truth, the secradow becomes [[undefined]], or has its drained condition increased by 1 if it's already drained, to a maximum of [[undefined]]."

  - name: "Rejuvenation"
    desc: " (occult) When a secradow is killed, it reforms on the Shadow Plane after 2d4 days, fully healed. A secradow can only be permanently destroyed by revealing the truth of the secret until it either becomes public knowledge or at least is established as fact to everyone with a direct connection to the secret (as determined by the GM)."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The secradow is hit with a Strike, and it was aware of the attack\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The secradow Steps and leaves an illusion behind momentarily; this doesn't prevent the triggering Strike from hitting due to reach, but it does grant the secradow the [[undefined]] condition against the triggering Strike, forcing the attacker to succeed at the usual DC 5 Flat check or lose the attack. Using Split deactivates the effect of the secradow's Never Show ability until the end of the current turn, allowing everyone to see that the secradow has actually been hurt until the Never Show ability returns."

Secrets weigh heavily on the souls of mortals, and sometimes this weight is so powerful that it can be felt even on the Shadow Plane. When this happens, the secret's ripple effect on the Shadow Plane can grow and transform into a secradow, taking on an appearance and knowledge similar to the creature who felt the secret's weight, though the secret twists the secradow's shadowy image slightly, giving clues to its true nature.

Secrets can only survive by staying hidden, so a secradow does all it can to stay that way. It single-mindedly hunts down and destroys all evidence of its secret's existence, caring little about anything else.

Coming into existence on the Shadow Plane does cause a secradow some problems though, as it doesn't have any inherent ability to move between planes. For this reason, a secradow usually finds another creature that can shift between planes and uses whatever means necessary to gain passage to the Material Plane so it can protect its secret.

## Crushing Weight

An unspoken romantic attraction can create a conflicted secradow whose existence depends upon fostering the interest while dissuading impulses to act on it. Such a secradow may impersonate the crush to lead its creator on, constructing an elaborate web of lies to support the emotional affair.
