Contrary to its appearance, a tree of eyes is actually a parasitic fungus that burrows throughout a living tree, killing it in the process, and then uses the tree as a host, hanging its exposed eyes from the branches. Creatures that make eye contact with one of these eyes are mesmerized and feel an intense urge to sleep at the base of the tree. The tree then engulfs the prey with its roots and slowly drains the creature of its nutrients.

Although the host of a tree of eyes is stationary, the fungus itself is not. It can move between these trees as easily as a human can walk, and over time, it will burrow into adjacent trees, often hollowing entire sections of forest. A truly desperate tree of eyes can use its host's roots to drag itself short distances.

The eyes of a tree of eyes contain its spores, which it uses as both a weapon and a means of spreading its fungus.

## Eyeing To Cultivate

Some humanoids have limited immunity to lung rot and become addicted to it. They then form cults devoted to harvesting and spreading eyes to new trees so they can bask in their hypnotic gazes.
