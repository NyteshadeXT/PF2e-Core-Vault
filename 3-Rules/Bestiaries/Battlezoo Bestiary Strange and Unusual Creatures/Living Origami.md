A living origami is a strange, natural creature that appears no different than its paper namesake. This tiny creature often takes the form of a tiny white dragon, beast, or bird, but it always comes from a single sheet of paper. Some believe that these creatures came into being from enchanted books or paper, while others believe that they are made of a rare leaf that closely resembles white paper. Living origami are only a few inches long and are as light as the paper they are made from. They are often very long-lived, living to 70â€“80 years.

Before they gravitate towards their chosen companions, living origamis are often found in gardens and forests. Here, they are cultivated by leshies, who consider them to be distant cousins before taking off on their own to find a companion. Once a living origami chooses a companion, it devotes its life to their well-being and safety. Sometimes, these creatures have been known to seek out ways to improve the quality of their companions' lives by helping to repair broken relationships or even acting as romantic matchmakers.

Living origamis often nest in places of knowledge and art such as libraries, schools, and art galleries and seek out the young and the creative. They often befriend dreamers and children, acting as friends, guides, spies, and even defenders. Wizards sometimes even take on living origamis as familiars, while children see them as friendly pets. When defending their adopted companions, living origamis can become quite defensive, often taking it into their own hands to decide whether or not others are good influences for their companions. These creatures can be won over by good deeds and delicious dollops of fresh ink.

Living origamis have no natural enemies, but they do fear creatures of fire. Unscrupulous hunters sometimes capture these creatures to sell them as pets, novelty items, or spies, as their ability to hide in plain sight makes them invaluable informers. These unlucky living origamis are doomed to an unhappy life confined to cages. Those who free these captives often find devoted companions for the rest of their lives.

## Living Origami Swarms

Though they tend to bond with other creatures, some living origamis prefer the company of their own kind. These wild creatures live far from civilization and form swarms of up to 1,000. They tend to use wings and claws to attack their enemies, killing them with countless tiny cuts.
