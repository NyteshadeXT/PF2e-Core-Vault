Some scholars claim that the curse of the werewolf originated in the fey realm, pointing to the cunomaglos as the first and greatest of werewolves. Indeed, these fierce faerie lords consociate with wolves of all sorts, spreading their affliction and leading mighty packs through shadowy fey forests. Some brave or desperate sages seek out a cunomaglos in the hopes of recovering otherwise forgotten lore, but the wolf lords never yield their secrets easily.

Unlike most werewolves, cunomagloi don't revel in bloody-minded destruction for its own sake. Rather, these wild fey live for the joy of the hunt and the legendary chase of worthy prey. They consume their prey's body and even taste their minds, learning their history and deeds and sharing their tales as trophies. The more thrilling the sagas collected, the greater the cunomaglos's status, leading cunomagloi to pursue renowned heroes and monsters to claim the honor of telling the stories of the vanquished.

## Passing The Sniff Test

Those wishing to pry secrets from cunomagloi often obtain tips on the whereabouts and weaknesses of tempting prey to trade. This tactic is a mistake, as a cunomaglos considers those who can obtain such coveted information as worthy prey themselves. A better strategy is to disguise oneself as a cunomaglos and participate in their storytelling as one of them. Few are willing to dedicate themselves so wholly to such a ruse, though, as the cunomaglos' keen sense of smell means one must become a werewolf to have a chance of tricking them.
