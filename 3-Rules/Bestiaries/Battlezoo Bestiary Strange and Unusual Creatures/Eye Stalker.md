    desc: "`pf2:2` (attack,occult) The eye stalker attempts an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, it deals 2d4 + 8 piercing damage as it extracts one of the creature's eyes, with the optic nerves still magically functional, from its socket. On a critical success, it extracts both eyes and deals double damage. A creature with all its eyes stolen is Blinded until it recovers one or more of eyes. A creature can retrieve the stolen eyes and return them to its empty socket with an Interact action. As long as they do so while the eyes last (typically within 1 week of being stolen), this instantly reattaches their eyes and restores their vision. Stories tell of creatures forced to replace their missing eyes with those from another creature robbed by an eye stalker, granting them unusual senses temporarily or permanently. This might be possible at the GM's discretion."

  - name: "Steal Sight"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The eye stalker has stolen at least two eyes using Extract Eyes\n**Effect** The eye stalker puts the stolen eyes in its empty sockets. It gains precise vision, as well as other visual senses from the creature whose eyes it stole (including darkvision), and it gains 15 temporary HP. The stolen eyes typically last for roughly 1 week, but if an effect would give the eye stalker the Blinded condition, that effect pops out their stolen eyes instead, removing any remaining temporary HP, if any as they fall from the eye stalker's sockets.\n[[Effects/Effect_ Steal Sight|Effect: Steal Sight]]"

Horrific aberrations that walk through the coastal mists, eye stalkers are the enemies of wandering drunkards and seaside encampments. Eye stalkers are tall, elongated creatures with greenish sallow skin, an emaciated visage, matted dark hair that falls to their feet, large claw-like hands that drag behind them as they walk, and empty, eyeless faces. To some, they might be mistaken for another taller humanoid, but to those who look beyond their greasy locks into the empty, gaping eye sockets beneath, they are a terrifying harbinger of imminent death.

Eye Stalkers normally can't see, as they have empty eye sockets set within their skulls. This makes them dependent on sound to find and hunt for their prey. They don't have external ears. Instead, all of their organs related to hearing are internal, with only a small cluster of holes on either side of their head. Despite this, eye stalkers are incredibly gifted in their ability to hear their prey.

As their name suggests, eye stalkers primarily steal and use the eyes of their victims to gain temporary sight, gouging out a victim's eyes and implanting them within their own empty sockets. Eye Stalkers who manage to prove themselves by stealing a victim's eyes are often chosen to lead other eye stalkers nearby, as their success indicates that they are capable of overcoming their prey. An eye stalker typically uses up a set of stolen eyes until the point where they are too decomposed to function. They then remove the rotted eyes and begin to search for a new pair.

## Eye Stalker Nests

Eye stalkers are known to 'nest' among seaside caves or rock clusters, folding their elongated bodies into tightly packed balls and huddling alongside one another in some kind of apparent hibernation. Though they roam seasides, eye stalkers don't venture out without the presence of fog or mist within the area.
