    desc: "  An abandoned's eyes are filled with bitter necrotic tears, which slowly leak out, leaving smoking wounds on their cheeks. This mixture hampers the abandoned's vision, causing it to be [[undefined]] in most circumstances. Once an abandoned has used Malicious Tears three times in the same 10 minute period, it loses the dazzled condition but also no longer meets the requirements to use Malicious Tears. The dazzled condition returns after 10 minutes, as the creature's decaying tear ducts produce more necrotic tears."

Some people die long before they draw their final breath. Abandoned are undead that felt the bitter sting of isolation in their final days or final moments, watching helplessly as those they loved and trusted left them behind. Their last moments were often filled with a deep shame and a desperate desire for revenge against those who abandoned them.

At first glance, abandoned appear to be simple zombies, but even casual observation reveals that they move deliberately and intelligently. Abandoned are much stronger than a zombie shambler and have the ability to use tools and plan simple ambushes. In combat, abandoned struggle to land blows against their foes, but they can unleash tears of loneliness and isolation to blind their enemies. After shedding enough tears, their vision clears, and they can unleash their frustration more effectively. When an abandoned is destroyed, they often scream the names of the people who abandoned them with a final rasping breath.

## A Will to Kill

Abandoned prioritize revenge against those who left them behind. They're often found patrolling homes and other locations associated with happier times, reliving memories while sobbing. Should they succeed in their revenge, the guilt of their victims causes them to often rise as zombie shamblers to accompany in death those they failed in life.
