    desc: "  The arrongtata commander's face is detached from its body, and there is a telepathic connection between the two. The face has two unblinking eyes that provide vision, hearing, scent, and the ability to perform a Stunning Glare. All other functions and abilities are performed by the arrongtata commander's body. When the arrongtata commander's body has its face in its possession, it perceives normally. The arrongtata commander's face can still see, hear, and smell even if it's away from its body, but it can only see whatever is visible from its current position, possibly making it unable to see, hear, or smell what's going on around it (using effects similar to the [[undefined]] and [[undefined]] conditions to handle this). Even if its head can see its body from afar, the confusion from the distant viewpoint causes the arrongtata commander to be [[undefined]] while it isn't holding its head."

  - name: "Shield Face"
    desc: "  The face of an arrongtata commander is incredibly sturdy, and acts as both a shield and weapon, though only for that arrongtata commander. When the arrongtata commander holds its arrongtata face in at least one hand, it can use the face to Raise a Shield, Shield Block, or Strike (Hardness 8, HP 48, BT 24). Because of their mystical connection to their head, when an arrongtata commander Raises a Shield with their head, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC, and if their face breaks, it remains partially functional. While broken, it can no longer be used to Strike but can still act as a shield with a circumstance bonus of +2 AC when raised. If an arrongtata commander's face is fully destroyed, the arrongtata becomes [[undefined]] and [[undefined]] and can't use Stunning Glare."

Arrongtata commanders are roving spirits with artificial faces they use as shields. They command phalanxes of their smaller kind to vanquish those that might harm nature. Arrongtata commanders are militaristic, constantly honing their skills in warfare.

* * *

Arrongtata were once kami who forsook their wards to seek out trespassers on sacred grounds. Abandoning their duty as kami allowed them to roam freely, but while they weren't punished nearly as harshly as oni, their choice still cost them their vision and most of their magical powers. To overcome this, arrongtata bound their bodies to a shield face that they crafted from natural materials. Arrongtata are hostile to any creature they believe will harm nature, though they get along surprisingly well with non-evil oni, as the two can empathize with each other's pasts, their choices, and the overly harsh punishments they've received. If their shield face is destroyed, they can craft a new one in a week, and it is sturdy enough to be used as shield material by those who manage to defeat them.

## Reading Faces

The material an arrongtata uses to craft a shield face carries personal significance. Most choose a material matching what they defended as kami, though others select something they wish to protect in their new roles. Front-line fighters often have faces made of hardy wood or metal for better protection. Strategists have rock faces that channel the wisdom of the earth, while grass or fur faces help scouts blend into their environments. But the most fearsome arrongtata are those with bone faces—they are spirits of vengeance with nothing left to lose, for all they sought to defend has died.

## Off With Their Heads?

Common sense suggests that killing a military unit's commander would throw the troops into disarray, making the arrongtata commander a tempting target. However, the telepathic connection between arrongtata adds a complication to that strategy. As demonstrated by the arrongtata swarm, arrongtata are more than capable of coordinating amongst themselves— strike down the commander and another takes its place. The correct play is to leave the commander alive and strike at its mind. It might be possible to mind control an arrongtata commander in order to have it send faulty orders to its troops. However, sometimes such an attempt can go wrong and lead to the arrongtata commander turning the tables by pretending to be controlled.
