Fury spheres are immense otherworldly metal spheres that were originally created by powerful immortal beings of good and law, early in the history of the universe. Each of these primordial spheres was infused with the spirit of a blessed being and put into place to help control a piece of celestial machinery. For a time, this was good, and the celestial spheres were happy... at least, until the day something went horribly wrong. The immortals who set the universe in order crafted a new and supposedly superior machine. But what is old and used is no longer perfect and ordered, so the immortal celestials cast the old pieces away to be melted down.

But the celestial spheres weren't merely some common metal to simply accept being smelted and reworked into something new. They felt their creators' betrayal, and so by infusing themselves with wrath and hatred, representing the diametric opposite of their old essence, they managed to escape their destruction and crash through the Heavens themselves. Multitudes of fury spheres poured into the planes, full of vengeful hatred for the gods and mortals whom they once toiled to serve. They now delight in chaos and the destruction of all things peaceful in order to spite their creators and strike back at the world that wronged them and left them behind. They'd rather watch the universe burn than allow themselves to become obsolete and quietly disappear.

Each fury sphere has a unique androgynous and rage- fueled face that appears on the surface of the sphere and always remains upright, no matter how fast the sphere is rolling. Fury spheres are made of shimmering metals of various hues. Some are the color of brass, some are silver, and some are black gunmetal, but on the inside, all are made of solid steel. Fury spheres are enormous spheres, 8 feet in diameter, that weigh over 60 tons.

Occasionally, a fury sphere comes up with a plan to seek out a high mountain, a labyrinth, a dungeon, or another area with narrow ledges and passages. Some evil beings have learned to negotiate and work together with fury spheres, promising untold destruction and chaos in exchange for the collaboration.

## Trapping A Sphere

When slain, the spirit of a fury sphere can be contained in a smaller vessel of Bulk 2 or less in the next 10 minutes with a DC 25 Arcana check, DC 25 Religion check, or DC 25 Occultism check check. The sphere trapped in the new vessel can be used as one of the ingredients for an _Animate Object_ ritual, creating an object that will begrudgingly follow commands.
