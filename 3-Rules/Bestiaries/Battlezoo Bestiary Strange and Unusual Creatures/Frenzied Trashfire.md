    desc: "  The frenzied trashfire naturally draws trash, refuse, and other debris into its body to fuel its flames.

    desc: "  Because the frenzied trashfire has a body composed largely of trash, weapons that build up a great deal of momentum and scatter that debris are very effective against it.

Other than the size and shape, this wall has the effects of a _[[Spells/Wall of Fire|Wall of Fire]]_ spell. The frenzied trashfire can see through the concealment caused by this effect. A frenzied trashfire can't use this ability again until it spends at least 1 minute absorbing more trash into its body."

A frenzied trashfire is an elemental creature formed of a large, roiling mass of trash and debris, surrounded by a dangerous fire. These creatures can spring up without warning in trash yards or other areas where pollution is common. While a frenzied trashfire is sentient, all known descriptions of these creatures describe them as being driven by a relentless rage. While that rage is often directed at the markers (or excesses) of civilization, it's hard to know if the creature's violent actions are deliberate or happenstance.

Scholars speculate that frenzied trashfires might be the result of failed magical experiments by druids aimed at striking a blow against civilization and the all- too-common pollution that it brings in its wake. This leads many to wonder if other types of pollution-tainted elementals might exist.

Due to their fragility to blunt attacks, frenzied trashfires prefer to attack from a distance, often hiding behind walls of flaming trash that they have created.

## Let It Glow

Some cities have found frenzied trashfires to be quite useful. They reduce the size of trash yards while preventing other unsavory creatures from taking up residence in them. Establishing a relationship with a trashfire requires magic to calm it and a translator to negotiate with it. Each trashfire has a different personality, so while some only want the city to burn, others have more of a live and let live attitude and are perfectly content consuming trash peacefully for others.
