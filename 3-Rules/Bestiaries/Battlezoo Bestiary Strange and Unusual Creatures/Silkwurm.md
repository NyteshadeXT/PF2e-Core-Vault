    desc: "  Any creature that Strikes the silkwurm with a melee weapon must attempt a DC 29 Reflex check save. On a failure, the creature is disarmed of its weapon, which becomes stuck to the silkwurm's body; if the Strike was an unarmed attack, the creature's limb sticks to the silkwurm's body and the creature becomes Immobilized. A creature must succeed at a DC 24 Athletics check check to retrieve a stuck weapon. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 piercing damage and the weapon remains stuck, and on a critical failure, the creature also becomes stuck to the silkwurm and becomes immobilized. A stuck creature takes 2d6 piercing damage each round at the end of its turn if it remains stuck to the silkwurm, and it can use an Escape action to try to free itself from the construct, with an Escape DC of 24."

For reasons unknown to biologists and the academic community as a whole, sometimes a megacolony of arachnids (primarily spiders) congregate together and, through unknown means, use the carcass of a creature to build a mobile, defensible home that can feed the teeming masses. The silkwurm is the most well-known example of this phenomenon, rampaging like a hungry cave worm.

Why this happens in the first place remains a hotly debated topic, as clearly some kind of intelligence and magic are involved, yet no obvious signs of them exist within silkwurms that are disassembled and studied. Esoterics posit that creating silkwurms is a behavior that normal spiders learned from intelligent spiders that descended from the Dreamlands. Meanwhile, naturalists think that a primal spirit helps the spiders in order to protect numerous colonies, arcanists are certain that silkwurms are some kind of golem-like construction, and religious zealots view silkwurms as grotesque idols for their gods.

## From Trash To Treasure

The weapons and other items that stick to a silkwurm hinder its ability to travel. The silkwurm "rests" after a successful battle to give the spiders time to consume organic material and discard anything inedible. It can therefore leave behind a literal treasure trove when it moves on. Since silkwurms don't have the intelligence for strategy, scavengers feel confident following them to recover the leftovers without needing to worry about them being a trap to lure in more prey.
