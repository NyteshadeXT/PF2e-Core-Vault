    desc: "  Despite their size, the fetchfisher can shift their body between planes to allow it to fit through tight spaces and take cover behind small obstacles that would be enough to provide cover for a Medium creature. While Squeezing, they can move at their full Speed. When using the [[undefined]] action, they can take cover behind Large or larger objects, reducing their space down from 15 by 15 feet to as small as 5 by 5 feet as necessary."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 3d6 piercing damage with a DC 22 Reflex check save. The swarm attempts to counteract all light effects in the area (counteract level 3, counteract modifier +12) by slathering them in fetchfisher oil. If the light effect is on a creature in the area, or an object worn or held by a creature, a successful Reflex save allows the creature to avoid the oil. The oil can be removed by spending an Interact action to wipe it off. This restores any light effects counteracted by the swarm."

Though they are wily and ferocious, few fetchfishers survive into maturity. Pressures, such as competition from other liminal predators and pelt harvesting by shadow giants, have driven fetchfishers to raise their young communally in large, vicious broods. Although fetchfishers' claws only begin to lengthen and hook as the kittens approach adolescence, their flesh-ripping fangs develop quite early.

A fetchfisher kitten is around the size of a common dog. They are long-necked, with an oily black coat and a slithering gait like a salamander. When a brood is hiding prone in the shadows, kittens are nearly undetectable except for the reflections in their eyes, which flash green in torchlight. A kitten's shadowy secretions are just as potent as those of an adult, but individuals don't seem to develop the finesse to slip between the cracks in the planes as easily until adulthood. Nevertheless, grease from a kitten's coat interferes with light sources and impedes movement as the substance permeates the boundaries between planes.

Fetchfishers prefer to nest in the shadow of a large, warm, consistent light source. A brood might be found within the shadow of a great forge, beneath the base of a beacon fire, or even adjacent in a planar dimension to a d'ziriak light weaving.

If left undisturbed in the dark, a fetchfisher brood is unlikely to swarm. However, hapless adventurers who carelessly shine light into a fetchfisher den soon find themselves dogpiled by dozens of oily shadows, bitten, shredded, and dragged halfway between the planes. Should the unlucky interloper manage to free themselves, they had best make themselves scarce. Fetchfishers rarely leave a brood without a babysitter nearby.

* * *

Fetchfishers are a family of mammalian beasts from the Shadow Plane that hunt on the borders between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. Exposure to shadowy energies can cause them to grow larger and more powerful.

## Fetchfisher Education

Fetchfishers are able to defend themselves and hunt in a brood even at a young age. However, at this point, their mind hasn't yet fully developed, and they act more like animals than their adult counterparts. Thus, responsible adult fetchfishers watch over a brood swarm. Adult fetchfishers use harsh but fair practical hands-on lessons to teach important topics like hunting, language, nearby threats, and geography.

## Fetchfisher Collaborators

On the rarer occasions that fetchfishers hunt on the Material Plane, they have been known to cooperate with mimics to launch elaborate ambush schemes. In these schemes, the mimic acts as bait, adhering the victim in place to allow the fetchfisher to either gang up on a solitary victim or to snatch and drag away a back-line ally to make the mimic's job easier.
