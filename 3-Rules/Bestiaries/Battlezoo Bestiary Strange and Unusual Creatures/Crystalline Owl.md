Difficult to see and even more difficult to catch, these translucent bird-like creatures are not crystal but fey. Crystalline owls are tiny beings, shy yet curious by nature. While usually not aggressive, crystalline owls often choose creatures, objects, or places to protect, and they fight to defend whatever they're guarding. They also attack if threatened, though they prefer to hide or flee. Their deceptively long legs allow them to reach out when they make an attack with their talons, but they do little to aid their mobility when grounded.

Crystalline owls are acrobats of the air, sometimes referred to as aerial monks. Along with their fluid grace, they embody some physical characteristics of crystals and possess the ability to manipulate light around them. This not only aids their stealth but also allows them to dazzle their enemies in order to more effectively attack or escape.

Most crystalline owls arrive in the Material Plan through naturally occurring interplanar bridges. Once on the Material Plane, these natives of the fey realm explore and adapt to their new surroundings. They usually hunt for a return path home or seek kindly beings with a connection to the fey. If they find such a friend, they might choose to form an attachment and eventually establish an empathic bond. Once bonded, a crystalline owl is fiercely loyal. When they mate, crystalline owls mate for life. Those who bond with another creature rarely form a mating bond as well. Guarding their nest is cause for more aggressive behavior than a crystalline owl otherwise exhibits, and they become quite territorial when their nest is on the line.

Although crystalline owls have a naturally long lifespan, too often they succumb to predators or other disasters for which they are ill-prepared, especially those living on the Material Plane. While rare, those who survive long enough manifest stronger abilities to manipulate light and fire. They also develop the ability to use their translucence to hide even more effectively.

## No Night Owl

Crystalline owls make excellent companions. Due to their use of bright light as a defense, they are not nocturnal like other owls. Hugging them, however, may not be a bright idea.
