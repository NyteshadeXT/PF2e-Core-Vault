    desc: "  Maramacula can mimic any sound it has heard, such as generic chatting noises or an infant's cries, by succeeding at a Deception check to Lie. Maramacula has a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. This doesn't allow Maramacula to mimic specific words."

  - name: "Cheat the Cheater"
    desc: "  Maramacula loves to play with its prey, even if results in losing its meal. A creature can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt a Deception or Diplomacy check against Maramacula's Perception DC (Deception check or Diplomacy check). On a success, Maramacula is [[undefined]] for 1 round, as it's compelled to spend the missing action to respond with a better reply or lie. The effect is cumulative if creatures succeed several times in the same round, and if the slowed condition increases to 3 or more in this way, Maramacula ceases its attack and becomes friendly to the triggering creature and its allies, as long as they cease hostilities as well. If a creature attacks Maramacula after it becomes friendly in this way, Maramacula becomes temporarily immune to Cheat the Cheater for 10 minutes."

Maramacula is an ancient beast renowned as a mischievous liar. According to legend, Maramacula is a marvelous fish with golden and rainbow scales, but the truth is... slightly different. This appearance is merely a facade, a rumor spread by Maramacula itself. These rumors assist it in settling down in a sewer or swamp and then making up lie after lie to lure innocent people to their doom.

## Master Mimic

Maramacula is a lethal trickster, mimicking all sorts of voices to attract prey. To ensnare a parent, Maramacula sends the cries of their lost child (perhaps a child Maramacula has already eaten). To trap a guard, all it takes are shouts from allies or superiors. The few who survive Maramacula are those who manage to captivate the creature and convince it to let them leave.
