A guillotine head is a disembodied, rolling undead head, a cousin of the beheaded. During times of great killing and death, officials place the heads of those killed by a guillotine or blade in great baskets as trophies to display to the public. With so much death, necromantic energies can send tendrils of unlife into these heads, causing them to awaken. A guillotine head has but one goal: to kill the one who removed their head and then cause as much death as possible to those who cheered them on.

A guillotine head is driven by its need to rip and tear with its teeth, often gnashing its teeth uselessly in the air if it hasn't had a chance to feed within the past few hours. Guillotine heads have no physical need to sate their undead hunger for food, though, as their form is simply a decomposing head. Those who have observed these creatures attempting to eat have claimed that any flesh that passes through their mouth quickly comes out of the base of their sliced neck.

A single guillotine head is not a great threat, though sometimes they form into a massive swarm of undead heads, sweeping across a city as an angry wave of undeath. This typically happens if a single bloody executioner kills countless people, as the victims work together to hunt down their shared executioner to enact their vengeance. In this event, they can become an unstoppable swarm, consuming anything in their wake and leaving behind a mess of chewed flesh and offal.

When these guillotine heads gather, their chittering and grinding teeth are enough to clear whole city blocks. It is such a horrific noise that it's been known to cause people's ears to bleed and their bowels to loosen.

If the guillotine heads can successfully locate their original bodies, they can reattach themselves, potentially transforming into another type of corporeal undead.

## Head Of The Family

Guillotine heads may find allies in family members who also seek revenge for their loved one's untimely decapitation. Few things in the world are as terrifying as a charge of orphans with their parents' heads in picnic baskets, ready to be thrown in the world's grisliest game of dodgeball. This strategy does have drawbacks, as victims of guillotine heads may themselves reanimate as guillotine heads if their attackers devour their bodies first.

## Don't Blink

A researcher once asked a colleague facing execution to blink as many times as possible during his beheading so that they could determine how long a disembodied head retained consciousness. Unfortunately, the colleague became a guillotine head. Rumors say that he is still blinking to this day.
