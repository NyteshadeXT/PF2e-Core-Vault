Fetchfishers are ambush predators that hunt at the edges of the Material and Shadow Planes. Although they are massive, ursine beasts, they stalk their prey by stepping through shadows and contorting behind natural and constructed edifices alike. When their quarry is distracted, a fetchfisher extends an impossibly long, taloned paw and snatches the startled victim away. These devilish hunters have been known to use roadside shelters, wells, and other essential structures as bait.

A fetchfisher resembles a three-story-tall sloth with the long neck and fanged maw of a humongous weasel. They are almost comically ungainly on open ground, but on the hunt, they move with extraordinary fluidity through the shadows. Fetchfishers contort, hug, and shrink their extremely elastic, supine bodies to fit behind nearly any cover precisely. They conceal their bulk on the connecting plane, the Shadow Plane when hunting on the Material Plane, or on the Material Plane when they hunt the Shadow Plane. With their sharp claws, they carefully comb and manicure a slimy, oily secretion into their fur, giving their coat an inky black color. This secretion is key to their ability to step into the Shadow Plane. How fetchfishers extend their forelimbs to such extreme lengths is less understood, but this must be a function of the creatures' extraordinary ability to shift their mass between planes.

On the Material Plane, fetchfishers are known only to specialized scholars, as they prefer to lurk just outside of the humanoid field of vision. To fetchlings and other people of the Shadow Plane, however, fetchfishers are feared, and so they take precautions against them. Fetchfishers understand the languages of their prey and can speak in a voice similar in tone to a fetchling child's. Occasionally they use deception as a lure, calling out for help or wailing like a child, but they seem to have little interest in conversation or diplomacy.

Fetchfishers are a family of mammalian beasts from the Shadow Plane that hunt on the borders between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. Exposure to shadowy energies can cause them to grow larger and more powerful.

## Fetchfisher Education

Fetchfishers are able to defend themselves and hunt in a brood even at a young age. However, at this point, their mind hasn't yet fully developed, and they act more like animals than their adult counterparts. Thus, responsible adult fetchfishers watch over a brood swarm. Adult fetchfishers use harsh but fair practical hands-on lessons to teach important topics like hunting, language, nearby threats, and geography.

## Fetchfisher Collaborators

On the rarer occasions that fetchfishers hunt on the Material Plane, they have been known to cooperate with mimics to launch elaborate ambush schemes. In these schemes, the mimic acts as bait, adhering the victim in place to allow the fetchfisher to either gang up on a solitary victim or to snatch and drag away a back-line ally to make the mimic's job easier.
