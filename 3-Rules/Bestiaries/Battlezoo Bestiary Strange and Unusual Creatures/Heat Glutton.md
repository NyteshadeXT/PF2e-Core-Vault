Intelligent magical offshoots of giant wolverines, heat gluttons are just as aggressive and temperamental, but the resemblance stops there. Heat gluttons are nomadic creatures roaming deserts and wastelands in a desperate attempt to satisfy their insatiable hunger for heat. Heat gluttons create their own permanent personal tundra, sucking in all the heat around them, desperately trying to keep their body temperature high enough to avoid permanently freezing to death.

According to legend, a glory-hunting nomadic hero once attempted to domesticate a pair of heat gluttons. Convinced he could keep them satiated through magical means, he supplied them with nearly unlimited heat upon which to feed. But the heat gluttons kept growing, both in size and hunger, until they eventually reached a size where even his most powerful sorcerers could no longer keep them docile. They had reached such a size that their personal tundra covered the whole desert, feeding on every living thing for miles around. None can tell how far they would have roamed and the damage they could have done if a silver dragon hadn't taken it upon themselves to solve the issue. The story provides a cautionary tale: heat gluttons are better left alone.

## Hunting Heat Gluttons

The personal tundra surrounding a heat glutton makes them remarkably easy to track and avoid, since they leave a trail of cold behind them. For an unaware traveler, however, the presence of an unexplained patch of ice in the desert might appear as a mystery to be resolved, leading the curious to their likely demise.
