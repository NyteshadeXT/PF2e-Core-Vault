    desc: "  Because they are creatures of dream, bannog thieves are uniquely vulnerable to magic associated with sleep and dreaming. Whenever a bannog thief makes a check to avoid a spell or effect with the sleep trait or a spell or effect that would cause the [[undefined]] condition, it treats the result of its check as one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on the check. Spells and effects that only work on sleeping creatures, such as the _[[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]]_ spell, work on the bannog thief at any time."

Bannog are a type of aberration from the realm of dreams that take the form of evil humanoid rabbits with human-like ears that stretch to well over a foot above their heads. Capricious and malevolent, bannogs travel from dream to dream in small family units in order to gang up on their prey. If they find a dream that seems especially fun or energetic, they might leave a clutch of eggs behind in that dream to gestate.

Although bannogs look mostly harmless, believing them to be so is a mistake. They produce a magical membrane over their paws that works as a touch poison that allows them to absorb dream energy from mortal creatures. While it serves as an effective defense mechanism, bannogs are usually careful about overusing it for fear of ending their food supply. The souls that bannogs trap with their poison usually don't hold much value to them, since the dreams of the soulless tend to be bland and depressing and to contain inferior energy.

Since bannogs rely on souls to survive but are relatively weak among all creatures that feed upon souls, they are deathly afraid of most beings involved in the soul trade. Rather than compete, if they meet any such creatures, they often try to offer their services as a desperate act of self-preservation.

Bannog thieves are cruel thrillseekers who enjoy the risks involved in hunting for souls. They often enter the Material Plane from an unsuspecting creature's dream, steal the souls of everyone nearby except a single person, escape the scene through that person's dream, and then expect the survivor to be blamed for the massacre.

## Bannog Characters

Some bannog misfits spend their lives on the Material Plane, which causes them to become able to sustain themselves on normal sustenance without the need for souls and changes the way they interact with dreams. These bannogs sometimes become adventurers or mischievous pranksters instead of malevolent tormentors. For rules of playing a bannog PC, check out World of Battlezoo: Indigo Isles!
