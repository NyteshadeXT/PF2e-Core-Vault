Practitioners of the arcane arts are often warned not to neglect the more mundane tasks of hygiene and cleanliness. As they grow in power and magical energies begin to permeate through their bodies, so too does residual magic linger in the hair, skin cells, fingernails, and toenails that most humanoids shed on a regular basis. When a mage becomes too engrossed in their studies to bother with such basic maintenance, these sheddings can sometimes congeal together to form an entity known as caster detritus.

Consisting of a tangled mess of shedding in a vaguely humanoid shape, a caster detritus has a complicated relationship with the witch or wizard from which it originated. On the one hand, a caster detritus owes its entire existence and power to the mage that shed it, and will often go to great lengths to protect them, sometimes without the mage ever knowing the caster detritus exists. On the other hand, caster detritus often harbors a deep-seated resentment for the mage that carelessly discarded them from their body. The protection a caster detritus begrudgingly gives is more to preserve their source of organic debris that makes up their form than it is out of any sort of gratitude. Secretly, many caster detritus plot to grow in power enough to eventually overtake their source mage. On occasion, a caster detritus might align itself with a group of adventurers seeking to slay the witch or wizard, providing assistance in exchange for sparing the source mage's life. Ultimately, the caster detritus seeks to incorporate the mage's entire body into its own, functioning as a parasite with an internal host.

## Sibling Rivalries

A particularly unhygienic mage may spawn multiple caster detritus, which is perhaps the origin of stories about them duplicating when cleaved apart. These siblings see each other as competition and battle until one remainsâ€”a life-and- death struggle that goes completely unnoticed by their absent parent. Occasionally, two detritus become entangled with each other and must learn to work together to survive. Such an argumentative pairing is called a dettin.
