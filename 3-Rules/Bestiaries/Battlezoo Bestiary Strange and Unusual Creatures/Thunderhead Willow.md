Thunderhead willows are electric trees native to alien forests, where incessant thunderstorms roil. Much of their time is spent chasing these storms, as they rely on lightning strikes for sustenance and to energize their natural abilities. They also serve as lightning rods to protect the forest, lifting their many branches high into the air and drawing the lightning to themselves. They then select the best time and place to discharge any excess energy.

When particularly large and fierce storms appear, these normally solitary creatures gather in groves and feed off of the frequent lightning bolts as well as each other's electric fields. Such gatherings are marked by dazzling electric displays and a chorus of singing in modulated and buzzing tones.

During calm weather, thunderhead willows relax their boughs and dig their roots into the ground, seeking subterranean electric pulses. At these times, many smaller forest creatures seek shelter under the umbrella of drooping, thin branches, as the strong current pulsing through these spiny branchlets deters many a predator with an unexpected shock.

## Wind In The Willows

Thunderhead willow seeds resemble fluffy caterpillars that dislodge from their branches during the winds of strong thunderstorms. These seed pods retain some electrical impulse that allows them to crawl until they find a good spot to grow. The electricity causes a tingling sensation in the mouth when eaten, which seems to appeal to some creatures. Digestion does not harm the seeds, so being eaten helps disperse the willows over larger areas.
