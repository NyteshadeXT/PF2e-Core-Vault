While confused, the target doesn't attack other oozes.

Often found clustered around chemical spills in abandoned laboratories, whorl oozes are the spawn of alchemical experiments with mind-altering or moodenhancing potions gone terrifyingly wrong. While most oozes are disquieting to behold, perceiving a whorl ooze is a sensory nightmare. The ooze's concentric swirling patterns defy and cloud visuospatial reasoning, causing onlookers to stumble about in disorientation. With a whorl ooze's devastating pseudopod attack, the unluckiest victims experience the horror of their bodies gelatinizing before they turn into oozes themselves.

Some who escape whorl oozes with their lives experience anosmia, persistent nausea, or the disturbing sensation of their bones turning to jelly. Stranger still, other survivors of particularly nasty encounters murmur about an underground war among alchemists, insisting that whorl oozes will be weaponized as pawns in a great coming battle. Only others who have beheld whorl oozes tend to believe these seemingly hallucinatory mutterings.

## A Prison Of The Mind

Adventurers have discovered villages where inhabitants seem to live in an alternate, terrifying reality. They don't perceive outsiders and behave as though in an alcohol-induced daze. The subsequent discovery of whorl oozes in one of the buildings revealed the oozes had shattered the villagers' minds, trapping them in a shared hallucination. Though their bodies had escaped the oozes, they'd left part of their psyches behind forever.
