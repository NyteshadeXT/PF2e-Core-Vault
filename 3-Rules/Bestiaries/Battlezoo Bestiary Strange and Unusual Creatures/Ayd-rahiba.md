  - name: "Swarming Tide"
    desc: "  The ayd-rahiba moves with an organization illogical to mortal minds. It can move into other creatures' spaces, and other creatures can move into its spaces. The spaces it occupies are treated as difficult terrain by other creatures. When the ayd-rahiba uses Form up, it can ignore the 15 foot limitation as long as its squares all occupy a single room."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the ayd-rahiba Strides, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the ayd-rahiba enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."

  - name: "Wall Glide"
    desc: "  After Retreating into the Walls, the ayd-rahiba moves behind the surfaces of walls, ceilings, and floors of a structure with illogical ease in a wet, slapping slither. The surfaces bulge obviously in ways that defy their material nature unless the ayd-rahiba Sneaks. After emerging to attack, the ayd-rahiba can't wall glide until it Retreats into the Wall."

An ayd-rahiba is a frightening and implacable troop of aberrations that swarm their victims from inside nearby walls, surrounding and devouring them.

What little is known about the ecology of ayd-rahiba concerns their bizarre habitat: they prefer to live within the walls of abandoned, desecrated structures. Their exact physical features are unknown; they are hidden within the walls, but when they attack, ichor-coated gangly black arms burst from behind plaster and crack the seams between stacked stone, plucking their victims off their feet and dragging them back to be crushed against the walls. The entire group of creatures moves and attacks with an eerily singular intent and coordination.

Any structure home to an ayd-rahiba bears marks of the ayd-rahiba's presence, and these marks are an adventurer's only clue of the impending danger. The ayd-rahiba's arms don't emerge from the walls smoothly like an incorporeal spirit: they burst out violently and physically. When an ayd-rahiba pursues prey, their arms rip their way across surfaces, tearing plaster or even stone like paper. Survivors noted seams of oddly repaired walls prior to being ambushed, meaning that the creatures likely repaired the damage they caused to their own lair in their violent hunts.

## Rahiba Roulette

Ayd-rahibas carry the mystery of their appearance to the grave, dissolving into black ichor when they die. Capturing the ichor requires a container made of organic material like leather—it seeps through everything else. Those who accomplish the task may drink it to gain the ability to wall glide, but doing so is a gamble; the effect lasts a variable amount of time per dose, and should it end while the drinker is inside a wall… the result is quite gruesome.
