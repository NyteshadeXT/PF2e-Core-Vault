    desc: " (linguistic,mental,occult) The supernatural ink sprayed by a writer's block shapes itself into passages of the author's unfinished prose upon making contact with a creature. The writing is distracting: creatures suffering from the writer's block's persistent mental damage are [[undefined]] until they recover. Once per turn, an affected creature can make a DC 20 Society check check to Decipher Writing as a single action to make a scathing critique of the writing. Succeeding on the check ends the persistent damage; on a critical success, the creature additionally becomes temporarily immune to the writer's block's mental damage for 1 hour, and the writer's block becomes [[undefined]]. These critiques are not subject to the writer's block's pithy retorts ability."

Many writers dream of leaving their mark on the world with a work of such staggering genius that they will be remembered long after their time has passed, achieving a sort of immortality through their magnum opus. The pursuit of such a masterpiece, however, invariably comes at a dire price. Sleepless nights and failing health, the descent into a hermetic life, and profane deals with otherworldly entities are all frequently encountered themes in tales told of authors in pursuit of perfection. Upon confronting the realities of a life of such toil, many simply give up, finding meaning and happiness in other forms. However, some scribes, utterly fixated on their goal, keep a white-knuckled grip on their quills until their final breath yet still fail to deliver their timeless work, falling just short of greatness. While the ink on the final pages of these obsessive writers' works quickly dry, the visceral force of their drive to create lingers on. Their haunted manuscript becomes animated by a tangle of their remaining emotions: obsession, frustration, and regret, creating a newborn literary spirit that doesn't contain any components of the author's soul. While the author failed to create a manuscript, they've brought something else into the world.

Some scholars have posited that powerful fey intentionally create writer's blocks in the First World in order to create lively sources of entertainment in particularly grand personal libraries or to pay tribute to deceased authors. In some cases, writer's blocks have been found being used as macabre paperweights by infernal creatures with a penchant for irony.

## Writer's Block Variants

Some writer's blocks may have additional abilities related to the contents of their writing, such as Forced Reading causing the frightened condition instead of flat-footed for a tale of horror.

## Unfinished Business

The worst outcome for dead writers is to become a ghost fixated on finishing their manuscript only to encounter the writer's block they left behind. The two creatures typically deadlock and require a third party to decide who wins out, but on rare occasions they end up collaborating to produce a haunting new story.
