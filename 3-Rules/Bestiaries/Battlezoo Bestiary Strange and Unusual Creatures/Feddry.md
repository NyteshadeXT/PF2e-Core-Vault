    desc: "`pf2:2`  A feddry can retreat into its rock, dropping equipment that can't fit into its rock torso. While hiding inside its rock, the feddry gains the benefits of greater cover, though other creatures can attack and destroy the rock to remove the greater cover. The rock is a Tiny object the size of a backpack with Hardness 7, HP 28, BT 14, and 1 Bulk. A feddry can speak and listen while hiding in its rock, but it can't see outside and can't take most actions that require the use of its body, particularly its hands or legs. This includes the use of its Strikes. The only move action it can take while Withdrawn into its Rock is to Roll. It can use Withdraw into Rock again to leave the rock's cover and return to its usual appearance. Other creatures might mistake a feddry in rock form for a rock as long as it remains still unless they succeed at a DC 20 Perception check or Nature check.\nEffect: Cover"

  - name: "Static Touch"
    desc: "  The vibrations a feddry makes generate a strong static charge. The first time each round that an adjacent creature hits the feddry with a melee attack, or a creature touches the feddry or hits the feddry with an unarmed attack, this static discharges, causing 1 electricity damage to the creature touched. A feddry can suppress or resume this static as a single action, which has the concentrate trait."

Feddry are amphibious humanoids who protect themselves by wearing rocks. Feddry typically appear as several feathery tendrils emerging from a porous rock, contorting into an exaggerated human-like face with feathery gills, bulging eyes, and a nearly accurate humanoid body. A feddry in this form is positively abuzz with excitement.

Feddry are best known for their simplistic views of the universe. To them, everything is either a feddry or a rock. Anything capable of movement or action, including air and water currents, is a feddry, while anything else is a rock. Rocks are meant to protect feddry. Many feddry engage in long, drawn-out debates over the nature of feddry and the use of rocks, making them quaint and befuddling conversationalists. Many feddry colonies can be found near coral reefs; though feddry can move farther inland, they prefer plankton-filled water for food.

Feddry outside of their rock homes have malleable bodies, which are made of long, flexible tendrils wrapped in layers. Even so, most feddry can't be convinced to take on any form other than a small humanoid with two arms, two legs, and a head, with their home rock serving as the torso. When at rest or scared, a feddry often retreats into its personal rock.

A feddry's rock serves as protective armor for most of its vitals; inside is a tangle of further tendrils, tubes, and bulges. Feddry have no concept of gender, and study has only determined that they have a plankton-like life stage before attaching to a proper rock.

## A Rock By Any Other Name

Although feddry are considered simplistic by many, their society is more complex than it seems to outsiders. One well-known incident occurred when a feddry's pet rock insisted that it was a feddry. The claim nearly led to a schism in feddry society until one of them pointed out that since all feddry would one day become rocks, there was no reason a rock could not become a feddry.
