If all of its gold pieces are within 5 feet of each other, it can use this action again in order to reanimate."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (concentrate,fire,primal) The goldsmyf can cause itself to explode in a fiery 30-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 8d6 fire damage (DC 29 Reflex check save). During the explosion, the goldsmyf can release the three gold coins that make up its body and use them as projectile weapons. The goldsmyf can target up to three creatures within the 30-foot emanation, dealing and additional 2d12 piercing damage to those creatures with the explosion; this damage is part of the explosion and is subject to the same basic Reflex save as the fire damage. At the end of the Aurumfire Explosion, the goldsmyf reforms back to its animated ant form adjacent to one of the creatures it targeted with coins (or anywhere in the emanation if it chose to target two or fewer creatures with coins)."

Goldsmyfs are the most sought-after guardians in the dangerous enterprise of fey- owned gastronomy. Imbued with powerful magic, these creatures guard the thing most precious to any businessâ€”the money. A goldsmyf waits undetected in its disanimated form of three gold coins for unsuspecting thieves who veer too close to the till or the safe. Not only can these guardians release a bursting puff of permanent dye that paints the thieves, but they also explode into flames when provoked.

The three coins of a disanimated goldsmyf are usually marked so those in the know can avoid touching the faux coins and setting off the dye bomb. Untrained eyes can't easily detect these engravings, but they can be found even by those who don't know of them if they look carefully and beat the natural talent of goldsmyf to disguise itself as normal coins.

An animated goldsmyf uses its three coins to form the three segments of an ant, with legs formed from green primal magic, mandibular pincers, and glowing emerald eyes.

Smyfs are a family of fey constructs, with bodies forged of disparate pieces of mundane equipment connected into a single entity by strands of primal energy. Each type of smyf serves a different role at restaurants connected to the realm of the fey. Coppersmyfs handle the venue and gather supplies; silversmyfs serve food to guests; and goldsmyfs protect the restaurant's finances. Together, they lend fey restaurants a unique style while guarding customers and staff alike. Their names arise from the type of object used to form their bodies: copper pots and bowls for a coppersmyf, silverware for a silversmyf, and gold coins for a goldsmyf.

## Goldsmyf Accountants

Sometimes, a goldsmyf becomes bored of simply remaining in a restaurant's vault disguised as ordinary coins. Such goldsmyfs turn their intellect toward other pursuits, and, given that they're surrounded by coins, money, and financial forms, they often take up accounting as a hobby. Goldsmyf accountants might not be mathematical geniuses, but their patience and ability to focus for long stretches on financial topics still make them impressive and implacable when it comes to filing forms, counting money, or implementing a restaurant's taxes.

## Other Smyfs

Smyfs aren't especially common to begin with, and of those, only coppersmyfs, silversmyfs, and goldsmyfs are seen on any kind of regular basis, even in the relatively obscure niche of fey restaurants. However, these aren't the only kinds of smyfs that exist. The following smyfs exist at least in stories and faerie texts, though whether they are fabricated or simply quite rare is still unknown.

*   **Platinumsmyfs**, whose enormous bodies include a furnace, are capable of cooking up new recipes.
*   **Electrumsmyfs** accompany silversmyfs or coppersmyfs on journeys delivering rare delicacies or purchasing ingredients in order to ensure appropriate payment and protect the payment on its return.
*   **Mithralsmyfs** are supposedly an advanced form of silversmyf, created to deliver especially perishable goods quickly, particularly when their destination is far away or in a dangerous area.
*   **Orichalcumsmyfs**, only mentioned in legends, coordinate all other smyfs across a vast restaurant empire, using their mastery over temporal magic and time management in order to manage dozens or even hundreds of other smyfs.
