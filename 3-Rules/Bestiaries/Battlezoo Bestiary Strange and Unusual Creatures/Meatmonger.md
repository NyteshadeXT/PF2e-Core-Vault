    desc: " (extradimensional,primal) Meatmongers create magical carts to store their products. The cart is Large, weighs 15 bulk, has 80 hit points and a Hardness of 5 (Break Threshold 40), provides tools for butchering, and holds up to 50 bulk worth of meat stored in an extradimensional space inside the cart. Meat carried in the cart is subject to a 5th level _[[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Gentle Repose]]_. As long as the meatmonger is pushing their cart, they gain a +10-foot status bonus to Speed and standard cover. A meatmonger needs two hands to push their cart. If a meatmonger's cart is destroyed, the stored meats pours out of the cart in a tidal wave of flesh. A meatmonger is able to make a new cart over 8 hours as long as it has appropriate materials. The cart loses its magic if the meatmonger that made it dies or abandons it.\n\n[[Creatures/Meat Cart|Meat Cart]]\n\n[[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Effect: Cover]]"

While friendly, a meatmonger attempts to sell the creature more meat at a cost of 10gp per 1 Bulk of meat. 1 Bulk of purchased meat eaten within 10 minutes of purchase has the effects of Fine Cuts. Once a friendly meatmonger is no longer able to sell meat, they leave and becomes indifferent; they don't attempt to victimize their customer for more meat."

Meatmongers are gregarious fey merchants who peacefully sell delectable and occasionally dubious meat from their large wooden carts... except when they're low on stock!

A meatmonger has a simple need to serve delicious meats to clients. But a meatmonger's client can never be sure exactly what kind of meat they are eating. Many people have taken to cannibalism because of a meatmonger. And many more have fallen victim to the meatmonger's need for new ingredients.

Meatmongers don't shy away from selling their wares to unscrupulous individuals either. It's not uncommon to find one peddling their goods to a gang of trolls or the hungry dead.

## No Meat For You

The meatmonger does not barter and only accepts coins for its goods. Hungry families who try to trade one of their own for a meal will find the meatmonger giving them the cold shoulderâ€”no, not the one in the cart. It is willing to pay for services rendered, though. Meatmongers are always looking for delectable spices and marinades, as well as blacksmiths to sharpen their blades. As a bonus to the income earned, meatmongers do not usually butcher those they find helpful.
