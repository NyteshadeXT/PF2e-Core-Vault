  - name: "Tongue of Nonsense"
    desc: " (divine) Even though adadas babble nonsense, all creatures who can hear the adada can understand their babbling as the random sounds twist their brains into comprehending the meaning. Adadas understand all spoken and signed languages in the same way, converting language into something chaotic enough to process."

    desc: " (aura,divine) 60 feet. Creatures within range attempt a DC 35 Will check save. On failure, the world melts into a chaotic morass of randomness and absurdity, causing the creature to become [[undefined]]. The flat check from this stupefied condition to avoid losing an action also applies to all actions using tools, weapons, or other objects, as the equipment's functionality sporadically becomes random and nonsensical. On a successful Will save, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) **Trigger** The adada becomes slowed or stunned\n* * *\n\n**Effect**: The adada attempts to counteract its [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] conditions (using its Performance modifier as its counteract modifier with a counteract level of 9). Regardless of whether it succeeds, it becomes [[undefined]] for 1 minute and can use the extra action to Strike, Stride, Burrow, Fly, or Swim."

  - name: "Anti-Poetry"
    desc: " (auditory,divine,emotion,mental) An adada's plume recites a sound poem on impact, which infects their victim with scathing and cutting satire that threatens to rip them apart, dealing 3d6 slashing damage with a DC 38 Will check save. On a critical failure, the creature is also [[undefined]]."

  - name: "De-Artifice Convention"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine,visual) **Frequency** Once per 1 minute\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The adada unmakes order in a 300 foot radius. Unattended objects without the magical trait become broken. The area becomes difficult terrain as the ground cracks, shifts, and transforms into formless absurdity. All creatures in the radius 12d10 bludgeoning damage from the sudden shift of aesthetics, with a DC 38 Reflex check save."

  - name: "Rhetoric of Violence"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The Adada babbles strange violent rhetoric, allowing it to make three confounding attacks as one. It Strikes three times with its tongue, each against a different target. These count as only one attack for its multiple attack penalty."

When convention and mandated structure crush the dreams of artists who would otherwise become once-in-a lifetime talents, the collective frustration from this loss spawns or attracts a terrifying creature of meaninglessness, an adada. Adadas spread unconventionality and irregular artistic visions in their wake, often causing calamitous damage as a side effect. Only the truly foolish would think to summon an unpredictable adada by design.

## Unfathomable Beings

Adadas are not malign creatures, but they have little to no regard for lives and property that they may ruin for the sake of their mission. But though their careless disregard can make them terrifying destroyers, they can also become unconventional saviors by battling tyrannical forces trying to dictate aesthetic sensibilities. At the same time, an adada might attract rival powers. When an adada clashes with one of its nemeses, the results are often more devastating than the emergence of either creature alone.
