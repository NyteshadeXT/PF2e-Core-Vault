The sounds always seem to originate from another room than the one the spoon is in and have a maximum volume equal to four normal humans shouting. Creatures who succeed at a DC 20 Perception check check can tell that the sounds are an illusion."

A haunting spoon is a fairly harmless construct closely related to animated objects. Haunting spoons are of little threat to most folk since they only move or attack when directly threatened with violence. They spend the rest of their time as a mild annoyance for anyone who would dwell in the same locale by acting as a repository for conversations and similar sounds, recording them, and replaying entire pieces at random whenever people come close. They are occasionally found in the households of hags or as a byproduct of homes that have seen violent incidents in the past.

While haunting spoons and similar constructs can be created intentionally and can come in variant forms, like plates or other cutlery, most often they occur naturally and in spoon form. After a house has seen many arguments or frequent crimes in or around it, a haunted spoon might arise from regular spoons in the area.

The sound that haunting spoons replay most frequently is the first thing they "heard" that catalyzed their original creation, which is usually a violent incident or a particularly strongly worded argument. More than one murder case has been accidentally solved when a haunting spoon began replaying the scene. This has led to experiments by law enforcement, criminal, and espionage organizations to make use of haunting spoons, but unfortunately, the spoons record so much that they quickly become useless as a tool to record and reproduce anything in particular other than the incident that spawned them.

## A Spoonful Of Sugar

A detective once noticed that cleaning a bloody spoon caused it to replay the murder that created it on a much less frequent basis. Further experimentation revealed that placing different substances on the spoon causes a haunting spoon to prefer replaying what it experienced when it last held those substances.
