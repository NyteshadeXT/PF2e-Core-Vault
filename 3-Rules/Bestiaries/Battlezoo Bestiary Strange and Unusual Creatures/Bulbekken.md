    desc: "  When the bulbekken takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage and has 10 or more HP, it splits into three identical gremlins. First apply the damage to the original bulbekken. Then that bulbekken splits open and dies, spawning three smaller bulbekkens, each with a third of the original's HP. Each of the new bulbekken is Tiny instead of Small. All three appear in the same space as the original and have their own uses of primal innate spells, with a spell DC of 15 instead of 17. Tiny bulbekken lose the Belly Burst ability and can't Swallow Whole. After about a week, they grow to full size, increase their spell DC to 17, and gain Belly Burst and Swallow Whole."

Among the larger members of the gremlin family when fully grown, a bulbekken resembles a miniature blue ogre, one riddled with bright orange boils and pimples, and a similarly colored pot belly that can spawn more of its kind. A bulbekken's diseased skin is no surprise, since the creatures' favorite pastime involves frolicking in urban refuse and eating the resident insects whole. They don't shy away from mud baths either. The boils on their skin reek of acid, and their bellies only grow larger with time as they gestate their spawn in mucus. Towards the later stages of life, one can even see the tiny bulbekkens kicking.

At the end of their short lifespan, the boils and stomach of the bulbekken explode, killing it, but birthing three new ones which remain and travel together as siblings until they grow up and burst themselves. The triplet bulbekkens maintain a familial resemblance to their parent and each other, though they often have completely differing personalities. One might be the quiet introvert while the other two squabble about everything under the sun, and each would certainly have a unique preference for seasoning their morning beetle stew. Nevertheless, though they might argue incessantly, a bulbekken's family comes second to nothing else.

The cycle of birth, growth, and bursting repeats in as little as two weeks when the area is nasty enough, resulting in bulbekkens quickly infesting any area they deem disgusting enough to call home. While they do quickly take care of any insect population, no city wants an exponentially growing band of plague-bearing bullies overrunning its garbage disposal sites and expanding their territory on a whim.

In spite of this, bulbekkens are not impossible to negotiate with. Many an adventurer has managed to convince a colony to immigrate to an even more disgusting place to live. It's especially easier to do so if the new home has weaker creatures to bully, since these gremlins fancy themselves the biggest threat around. Some stories even tell of bulbekkens being easily charmed by song, but others contradict this with assertions that bulbekkens hate any and all music. What's certain is that their large, elephant-like ears are as sensitive to sound as bulbekkens are about their ears' appearance.

## Plague Carriers

Bulbekken skin is a reservoir for diseases it encounters, passing the contagions to those who touch it. In the rare instances where a bulbekken colony hasn't been exposed to other diseases, they spontaneously develop their own: bulbenesis, which, if left untreated, results in a fully grown bulbekken bursting out of the victim.
