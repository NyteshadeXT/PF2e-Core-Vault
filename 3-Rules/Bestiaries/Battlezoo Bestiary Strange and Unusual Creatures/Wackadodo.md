    desc: "  Each of a wackadodo's heads rolls their own initiative and has their own turn. Neither of the wackadodo's heads can Delay. At the start of one of the wackadodo's heads' turns, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Either of the heads, or both, can move the wackadodo's legs on any given turn. Any ability that would sever a wackadodo's head (such as the vorpal weapon property) doesn't cause the wackadodo to die as long as the wackadodo still has their other head intact, but it does cause the wackadodo to lose the turns, actions, and reactions that would ordinarily come from the severed head. Mental effects that can only target a single creature affect only one of the wackadodo's heads, but not both."

Wackadodos are two-headed birds that fight via discombobulating movements and a strange disease they spread that gives their victims a growing urge to dance. They stand between 5 and 6 feet tall with elongated necks, stubby wings, and long legs that end in large talons. Uncharacteristically for avians, the bird has sharp teeth in its beaks. The species brandishes a large fan of feathers for a tail, consisting of many colors, which they use to engage in abnormal dances. These dances are a means of communication between wackadodos, but they also double as a way to attract prey. Sometimes, during a rare astrological event, many wackadodos engage in dancing together, but the meaning of this odd ritual is unknown.

## Trendy Dancer

Dancing for wackadodos can distract them from blind aggression. Experts recommend keeping up with new trends as wackadodos enjoy studying and imitating dances they haven't seen before. When witnessing familiar dances, they often interpret them as a message that usually causes them to either become friendly with the dancer or fly into a rage and attack the dancer. On the other hand, when witnessing a new dance, the dancer must be careful as well, as ending a new dance before the wackadodo has absorbed its nuances may cause the bird to bite the dancer to encourage the dance to continue.
