    desc: " (poison,void) When a lantern leshy is destroyed, it explodes in a blast of necromantic energy. Due to its origin, this energy only affects plants, doing 1d10 void damage to each plant creature in a 30-foot emanation with a DC 15 Fortitude check save. This burst causes plants in the area to rot, creating a disgusting miasma that lingers in the air for 1 minute. Any creature that breathes must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude check save any time it enters or ends its turn in the area while the miasma lasts.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is temporarily immune to the miasma for 1 day.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected this turn.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[undefined]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[undefined]]."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (emotion,fear,mental) The lantern leshy can remove its head and toss it to attack a foe. It makes a head Strike against a foe; this ability is the only way it can make a head Strike. Whether the Strike hits or misses, any creature within 20 feet of either the lantern leshy or the Strike's target must attempt a DC 18 Will check save or be [[undefined]] ([[undefined]] on a critical failure). The lantern leshy's head does not return after being thrown until it retrieves and reattaches it. It is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until then, though it always precisely senses its own head. Picking up and reattaching the head requires a single Interact action by the lantern leshy, which it can do as long as the head is within its reach."

  - name: "Spooky Decorations"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The lantern leshy collapses into a pile of sticks and withered leaves with its illuminated head sitting on top. Creatures who come across the lantern leshy in this form must succeed a Perception check check against its Deception DC to recognize that it is not simply a decoration. This lasts until it uses this action again to regain its original form."

The moment a leshy's spirit leaves its physical body is generally dramatic and explosive, but those clever or driven enough can either salvage the leshy's form afterward or prevent the explosion in the first place, often through magical means. Once the leshy's remains are gathered, it's relatively easy for such individuals to take the next step and reanimate them.

When a gourd leshy is the subject, the result is a lantern leshy. A lantern leshy's body is a tangle of withered vines and leaves, but their gourd heads remain surprisingly fresh and intact. Their creators often carve frightening faces, pictures, or symbols into these heads to make them more terrifying. And of course, a magical fire glows from within the gourd head, giving the lantern leshy its name.

Even the friendliest-looking lantern leshy possesses a vicious intellect, and nothing brings them more joy than tormenting victims. A lantern leshy might stalk their prey multiple nights in a row, playing cruel tricks. Eventually, they grow bored with such games and kill their targets, often in slow and creative ways.

Nothing about the process of creating a lantern leshy bonds them to their creator, and thus their loyalty varies wildly. A lantern leshy's creator gains a lifelong evil companion as often as they accidentally create their own murderer.

## A Worse Headspace

A lantern leshy can still store objects in its head in the same manner as a gourd leshy, but the magical flame destroys objects that are flammable. Typical items a lantern leshy might carry are metallic weapons and torture implements. They arrange the objects around the flame so that it casts enlarged shadows of them against its face, giving their victims the terror of anticipating what cruelty it may inflict next.
