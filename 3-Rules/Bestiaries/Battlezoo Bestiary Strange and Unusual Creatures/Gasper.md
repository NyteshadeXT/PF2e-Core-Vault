Gaspers are bizarre, aberrant elementals, sealed inside a prison of rubbery skin, that choke to death whenever other living creatures get a good look at them. A gasper typically appears as a lanky creature with humanoid forms covered in yellowed rubbery skin that appears to have a life of its own. This sickly skin is stretched over its tall, malformed frame. Living creatures never get a chance to see a gasper's face up close, as it seals shut at first sight with muffled cries and whimpers. A gasper's torso bulges and throbs violently to unnatural proportions as it starts asphyxiating, and it lunges, rushing towards onlookers in reckless abandon. After all, if it kills them, it can breathe again. If the onlookers are obviously too powerful, the gasper attempts to flee beyond breathsense range instead. Gaspers at the end of their breath gouge themselves with their own spines to extend their consciousness.

Gaspers can be found in nearly any climate in reclusive places and underground sanctuaries, as they avoid the lethal effects the gaze of the living has upon them. Yet gaspers inevitably emerge to lumber listlessly on the surface for a moment before returning to safety, their heads craned towards a sky they can't see.

Due to their self-imposed isolation, gaspers are virtually unknown in the outside world, which is unfortunate for many crossing their path since they mainly attack for self-preservation.

Gaspers are usually forced to live solitary lives, but that doesn't mean they don't get lonely. They often find companionship with sightless creatures, intelligent undead, and constructs. Gaspers' companions are sometimes benign, but undead and other evil companions might hang around the gasper mainly to use its breathsense as a rudimentary detector for living victims.

Inscrutable accounts that attempt to explain a gasper's unique physiology claim that a gasper's skin is a separate aberrant entity added to an air elemental due to some kind of curse or punishment. One piece of evidence that supports this possibility is that when a gasper dies, its skin slumps lifelessly, leaving nothing more than an empty husk.

## A Suitable Ending

Gasper skins are in high demand among those who know of their existence. If handled very carefully, they can get a second life as skintight suits for athletes, divers, and industrial workers who need the protection and efficiency offered by clothing that is nigh impenetrable except by slashing.
