    desc: "  Whenever the plug-tailed wolly is Grabbed, the plug-tailed wolly takes a critical hit from an attack that deals slashing damage, or a creature attempts to Escape from Crawl Down Throat, there's a chance the creature grabs a tail instead of the wolly, splitting the wolly into two creatures. If the plug-tailed wolly has at least 4 HP remaining (after applying any damage to the plug-tailed wolly), it splits into two identical plug-tailed wollys, each with half the original's Hit Points. When the plug-tailed wolly splits, one remains in the same space and the other appears in the nearest unoccupied space."

  - name: "Crawl Down Throat"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The plug-tailed wolly's last action was a successful claw Strike against a Medium or larger creature\n**Effect** The plug-tailed wolly crawls down the target's throat, contracting and expanding its body to fill the throat, with its tail stuck out of the creature's mouth. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the plug-tailed wolly moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The plug-tailed wolly is Off-Guard while down another creature's throat. The plug- tailed wolly interferes with the creature's ability to speak while in a creature's throat. When attempting verbal spell components or actions requiring precise vocalizations, the creature must succeed at a DC 7 Flat check or lose the spell or action. A creature can pull the plug-tailed wolly out of the target's throat with a successful DC 17 Escape check."

A plug-tailed wolly is a badger-like creature with brightly colored fur of various colors, highlighted with black and white stripe markings. Whenever a plug- tailed wolly feels threatened, it either attempts to flee or crawls into a safer space, potentially including its attacker's mouth!

In order to crawl down a creature's throat, a plug-tailed wolly contracts and expands its body (sometimes even to several feet in diameter) and tries to claw the creature from the inside, leaving its many tails sticking outside the creature's mouth. When someone pulls on the tail of a plug-tailed wolly inside a creature's throat, a new plug-tailed wolly instantly spawns from the pulled tail.

If left alone, a plug-tailed wolly is usually inquisitive and playful, but they can quickly turn skittish or violent if threatened. Many farmers, foresters, and trappers have shared tales of a plug-tailed wolly attacking a too-noisy companion or a barking dog. In such cases, the plug-tailed wolly typically manages to evade capture thanks to its strange abilities.

## A Sailor's Best Friend

A tame plug-tailed wolly is a common sight aboard ships. The creatures are not fully domesticated but have acclimated to the presence of humanoids to the point that they will not attack the crew. They are excellent for morale, as the sailors delight in their colorful appearance, but they are also important during emergencies. Should anything puncture the hull, the crew uses the plug-tailed wolly and its split duplicates to plug leaks until a more permanent solution is available. As for situations where the ship runs low on suppliesâ€¦ wolly meat tastes like stringy chicken, and the original wolly never needs to know what happens to its spawns.
