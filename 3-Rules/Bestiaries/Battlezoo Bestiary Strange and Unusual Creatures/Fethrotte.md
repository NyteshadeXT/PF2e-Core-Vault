A fethrotte is a markedly unintelligent, cantankerous, solitary creature that typically leads a short, painful life due to their singular purposeâ€”a disposal system created to devour dangerous chemicals in alchemical laboratories. It moves slowly on its disproportionately small, overworked feet as it drags its distended, corpulent belly behind it. Behaviorally, fethrottes are aggressively territorial. Normal food will no longer sustain them, and so they are utterly reliant on its alchemist creator and the lab where its food is generated. Try to remove a fethrotte from its home, and it will fight obsessively and mercilessly. It may appear to be a common giant rat, but elemental grotesqueries come belching from between its gnarled teeth, and mutagenic mutations enable it to alter its very body to better rend an intruder.

While a fethrotte is not a particularly uncommon sight in an alchemical lab today, the specific origins of the creature are lost to time, though the haunting procedure to create one has spread since then. The process involves feeding a mundane giant rat a caustic mixture of mutagens and other alchemical drippings to create a servant perfectly suited to cleaning up the dangerous fluids and runoff of an active laboratory. Adventurers are advised to pay heed to an addendum penned after an alchemical researcher's final entry by their assistant: "Do not touch the corpse of a fethrotte, or your assistant will be entirely out of a job."

## Cautionary Tails

Alchemists tempted to speed up the cleanup process by keeping more than one fethrotte quickly learn that fethrottes eat anything they consider food, including each other. The last thing an alchemist needs in a lab is more explosions, so a chain reaction of detonating cannibalized rats is not an appealing concept. They've also learned to monitor fethrottes that survive longer than usual. Their rate of mutation increases as they grow, and they may develop undesirable traits such as spewing elemental damage in a cone, changing sizes uncontrollably, growing wings, or birthing copies of themselves. Perhaps taking the time to clean up one's own messes isn't so bad after all.
