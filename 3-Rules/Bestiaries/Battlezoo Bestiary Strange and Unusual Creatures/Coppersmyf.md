Polished to a mirror-like rose gold sheen, gleaming coppersmyfs serve as the workers, custodians, guardians, and suppliers of eateries with close connections to the fey realm. These establishments, usually run by plucky gnome restaurateurs, are known for their secret recipes and obscure ingredients from the fey realm. Coppersmyfs, which protect recipes and rare ingredients at all costs, are key to a competitive advantage and have earned their formidable reputation.

A disanimated coppersmyf looks to the untrained eye like nothing more than an inconspicuous assortment of four copper mugs, two copper bowls, and a meat cleaver. When animating, the copperware swirls with green primal magic, binding the pieces together to create the coppersmyf form. At the formed figure's center, two copper bowls fuse into an orbed "torso," bearing a large white eye that reflects with the brilliance of direct sunlight on metal. The remaining pieces assemble to form "arms" of magical energy, one of which wields its razor-sharp weapon.

While they typically spend most of their spare time in kitchens, coppersmyfs serve in various capacities for restaurants according to their individual temperament and state of animation. Most guard their kitchens with militaristic vigilance, firing out a disintegrating eye beam at any would-be thieves or giving chase with their meat cleaver. Other coppersmyfs are paragons of efficiency who happily chop up ingredients and assist with preparing food. Some coppersmyfs prefer to spend the day in their disanimated form, functioning as ordinary cookware, springing to life when the restaurant is closed so they can be effective guards around the clock.

Chefs also covet coppersmyfs as covert transporters of rare delicacies from the fey realm. A coppersmyf transporting ingredients can have a variety of expensive ingredients hidden inside its bowls, allowing it to safely transport them to and fro.

Exceptionally cunning gnome chefs and restaurant owners put out mundane copperware components in the exact number and configuration that comprise a coppersmyf. Though this is incapable of forming a coppersmyf, the ruse can be an effective deterrent for recipe thieves, and it's certainly much less expensive than commissioning a coppersmyf.

Smyfs are a family of fey constructs, with bodies forged of disparate pieces of mundane equipment connected into a single entity by strands of primal energy. Each type of smyf serves a different role at restaurants connected to the realm of the fey. Coppersmyfs handle the venue and gather supplies; silversmyfs serve food to guests; and goldsmyfs protect the restaurant's finances. Together, they lend fey restaurants a unique style while guarding customers and staff alike. Their names arise from the type of object used to form their bodies: copper pots and bowls for a coppersmyf, silverware for a silversmyf, and gold coins for a goldsmyf.

## Smyfs Of All Trades

As the lowest-ranking smyfs, coppersmyfs more so than any other smyfs learn how to perform a variety of tasks at the restaurant, allowing them to fill in wherever they are needed. Comparatively, silversmyfs and goldsmyfs have specialized roles, and they typically fulfill those roles thoroughly. While this might mean that coppersmyfs are masters of none, their ability to serve many roles as a versatile jack of all trades, combined with the relatively low expenses required to create a coppersmyf, make them much more prevalent in gnome and fey restaurants than the other more powerful varieties of smyf.

## Other Smyfs

Smyfs aren't especially common to begin with, and of those, only coppersmyfs, silversmyfs, and goldsmyfs are seen on any kind of regular basis, even in the relatively obscure niche of fey restaurants. However, these aren't the only kinds of smyfs that exist. The following smyfs exist at least in stories and faerie texts, though whether they are fabricated or simply quite rare is still unknown.

*   **Platinumsmyfs**, whose enormous bodies include a furnace, are capable of cooking up new recipes.
*   **Electrumsmyfs** accompany silversmyfs or coppersmyfs on journeys delivering rare delicacies or purchasing ingredients in order to ensure appropriate payment and protect the payment on its return.
*   **Mithralsmyfs** are supposedly an advanced form of silversmyf, created to deliver especially perishable goods quickly, particularly when their destination is far away or in a dangerous area.
*   **Orichalcumsmyfs**, only mentioned in legends, coordinate all other smyfs across a vast restaurant empire, using their mastery over temporal magic and time management in order to manage dozens or even hundreds of other smyfs.
