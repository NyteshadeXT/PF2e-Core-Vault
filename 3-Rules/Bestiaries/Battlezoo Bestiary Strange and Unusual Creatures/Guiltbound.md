    desc: "  The guiltbound is linked to their murder weapon, either a specific type of weapon (hatchet, for example) tied to the murder that created them, or one determined randomly. The guiltbound wields a spectral version of this weapon, with its murder weapon Strikes gaining the weapon's damage and traits, using a damage die one size higher for a simple weapon (the listed damage is for a longsword). A guiltbound also possesses weakness 10 to that specific type of weapon."

When a murderer shares a grave with their victim and the murder weapon (whether interred in a mass grave, buried at sea, or through sheer coincidence), the profane energies of the massacre fuse the three together, causing them to rise from the grave as a hideous amalgam. Bound together, the murderer is eternally presented with a grisly reminder of the deed they committed in life: the victim's corpse, likewise reanimated and perpetually gripped by fear, dangles from the murderer in place of one of its arms.

A guiltbound is unable to venture far from its burial site and can often be found lingering near its grave. Paradoxically, their horrific appearance contradicts their behavior, as they tend to ignore those who have never committed murder and usually don't pose an immediate danger to those who have lived a peaceful life. Most give them a wide berth regardless. Moreover, some communities have used guiltbound as a way of determining guilt: if a guiltbound can see a suspected murderer, they are likely the perpetrator. In such cases, the guiltbound often also conveniently fulfill the role of executioner.

## Grisly Sentry

A guiltbound can often unintentionally act as a guard for small communities, remaining unaware of innocent denizens while unerringly pursuing interlopers with a history of killing. A guiltbound possesses no nuance about who it sees as a murderer; justifications of self-defense will prove to be no defense at all.
