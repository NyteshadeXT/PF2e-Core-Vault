The product of experimentation now lost to the ages, cloaked cadavers are as dangerous as they are rare. Named after their cloaked appearance, they are best known for their terrifying ability to paralyze their victims and consume their souls.

Few survive encounters with these malevolent beings, though not many encounter them to begin with. Survivor stories and reports indicate a preference for damp, dark places and a vulnerability to sunlight, a leading factor in the survival of many unfortunate enough to stumble upon one. Cloaked cadavers are generally found lurking around ancient sites and ruins, most often alone or in pairs. Some stories mention more powerful variants that might form after a cloaked cadaver consumes countless souls. When attacking, cloaked cadavers first attempt to neutralize any threats by paralyzing their victims before going in to drain them with an embrace.

Many scholars speculate that the few remaining cloaked cadavers are among the last of their kind, sourced from a single original batch long ago. This theory has piqued the interest of scholars, necromancers, and explorers alike, who seek to understand cloaked cadavers' hidden origins and trace them back to their ancient creators.

## Cloak Of Many Colors

Scholars have noted significant discrepancies in how survivors of cloaked cadaver encounters describe their cloaks. Some accounts call them tattered and grimy, while others speak of ornate embroidery and vivid colors that resemble royal funeral shrouds. The condition of the cloak may reflect the power and number of souls a cloaked cadaver has consumed.
