Lurking near desert roads, the mirage crawler is a vicious ambush predator. Often mistaken for a large boulder, it resembles a massive, asymmetrical clam with sand-colored shells. When the crawler opens itself, the spongy mass of flesh and mucus contained within bulges outward. Its spindly, unevenly spaced legs are then pushed out, revealing these crystalline appendages to be covered in a network of sensory bulbs and sand-filled blisters. Slow to move on the surface, mirage crawlers move with uncanny speed when digging underground. When hunting, the constant skittering and twitching of a mirage crawler's legs releases a cloud of sand that surrounds the creature and allows it to grab unsuspecting prey. Despite its unimpressive intelligence, a mirage crawler exerts a great deal of control over the sand cloud that constantly surrounds it, allowing it to form images in the cloud to distract its foes.

Although it is fortunate that these crawlers are typically lone predators, they occasionally gather during certain astronomical conjunctions for their nigh- unpredictable mating season. The ensuing feeding frenzy often ravages nearby communities, leaving behind the remains of the mirage crawlers' victims, shaped by their alien digestive tracts into hollow, oblong pearls of petrified bone.

## Pearls Of Wisdom

Foolhardy treasure hunters search for mirage crawler bone pearls with the reasoning that since regular pearls are valuable, these must be as well. They are not, and the wise move is to leave them alone. Fertilized mirage crawler eggs look almost identical to the digested remains and spawn ravenous larvae that devour any organic material they can wrap their maws around. They resemble cave worms, though they are not as powerful, and remain in that life stage until they eat enough rock and crystal to grow a shell and legs. Should adventurers kill a larva before it transforms into a mirage crawler, they may find some precious metals in its stomach, but the value is rarely worth the risk.
