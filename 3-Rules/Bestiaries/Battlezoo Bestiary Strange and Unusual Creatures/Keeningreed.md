Believed to be cousins to keyweeds and kelpsteeds, keeningreeds are the most mysterious member of their family of plant creatures. They stalk ancient battlefields, singing lullabies to the spirits that linger. But precisely why they are driven to do so is not known for certain.

Unlike their cousins, keeningreeds are capable of speaking out loud, and they possess a whispering voice that sounds like reeds rustling in the wind. However, they rarely show interest in talking to the living. Only those who have recently lost someone tend to earn their attention.

Peasant superstition holds that this isn't true compassion; they say keeningreeds need the passion of human grief in order to produce offspring. Some believe that keeningreeds were the creation of an order of druids that sought to heal the scars of an ancient war in their homeland. These druids supposedly didn't want to invite meddling priests to wield divine magic in their domain, and so they created keeningreeds. Since then, keeningreeds have spread quietly through shadowy woods and gloomy marshes.

While some raging spirits can only be laid to rest by direct force, often keeningreeds prefer to take a gentler approach, conversing with the spirits and soothing them before final departure. Sometimes keeningreeds take up the unfinished business of a spirit, either in order to help them depart or to honor their memory.

One company of adventurers became famous for allying with a keeningreed on their adventures. The keeningreed provided them with details on treasures that were theirs for the taking if the spirits haunting them could be given final satisfaction.

However, another version of the story has a grimmer ending. After many adventures, it turned out that the final satisfaction was given to an enemy those adventurers had slain many years ago...

Keyweeds are a family of diminutive plants who are known to perform quirky and unexpected activities, such as breaking into locks, swimming alongside other creatures, or even creating music to calm the spirits of the dead. The name refers to both the family as well as the most famous member of the family, the creature known as keyweed, a plant that loves to pick locks and disable devices.

While keyweeds' origin aren't entirely clear, many scholars have come to believe the most widely spread legends, which tell that keyweeds were created by druids to fulfill a variety of unusual niches where no other plants possibly could. Other theories exist, including those of some scholars who believe that keyweeds were originally humanoids who transformed into plants due to the blessing or curse of a deity of nature. For instance, one fairy tale parents tell to little children who are caught filching something is that if they misbehave and steal from others, the Green Man might come to the house at night and transform them into a keyweed, spiriting them away into the woods forever, never to see their families again.

Keyweeds have an unusual relationship with leshies based on their similarities and differences. Both are small sapient plant creatures, and if the stories are true, both originated from druidic magic, but leshies are nature spirits, or vitae, that directly incarnated in a mortal plant body through a primal ritual. While their progenitors might have been created by druids, keyweeds are mortal plants through and through, living, reproducing, and dying just like any other plant does.

## Keeningreed Choruses

Sometimes, a spirit's wishes are too great for a single keeningreed to fulfill on its own. In this case, a congregation of several keeningreeds, known as a chorus, might work together to achieve what a single keeningreed couldn't on its own. Nearby settlements sometimes pass down stories of the eerie symphonies they heard during the night while such a chorus was hard at work.
