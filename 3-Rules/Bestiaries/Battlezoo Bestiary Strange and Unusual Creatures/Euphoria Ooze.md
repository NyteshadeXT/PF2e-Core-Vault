The result of an enchanter's successful experiment, euphoria ooze emits an addictive gas that brings unparalleled happiness to those who inhale it. The experiment proved lucrative, and soon more of its kind were produced and farmed for the drug. Some inevitably escaped, using their unusual elasticity and overpowering aura to slip through their confines.

Though mindless, euphoria oozes possess a particular affinity for magic. This causes them to settle around magical environments and seek out spellcasters when they can. In turn, enterprising adventurers often embark on ill-advised journeys to catch and harvest these creatures, underestimating the potency of their fumes. These ventures frequently end with the adventurers falling in battle to the vapors or succumbing to their addiction.

Euphoria oozes appear and feel more solid and rubbery than most others of their kind. In fact, the minimal oil their body excretes sizzles and evaporates into dark smoke at the slightest spark, protecting it while dampening its elastic abilities for a brief time.

## It's A Keeper

An unanticipated function that enchanters later discovered is the euphoria ooze's ability to preserve food. Since it was created to be low-maintenance, the ooze does not need to eat to survive. Instead, it synthesizes its biological requirements using air, water, and light. That means it lacks the acid other oozes use to digest matter. Instead, its body provides airtight storage and oils that act as preservatives. Stick travel rations or leftovers inside its body, and they will remain safe to eat for years!
