    desc: "  An erygloid's body is covered in a magical acid that eats away at living creatures but is more efficient at digesting magic. On a successful toothy tendril Strike or when a creature fails its save against Constrict, the erygloid deals 1d6 additional acid damage and attempts to counteract one spell affecting the target, or one of the target's magic items, with a counteract modifier of +10 and a counteract level of 2. On a success, the erygloid ends the spell or causes the item to become a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes; this doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the chosen item is an artifact or similar item, the counteract check automatically fails. Strangely, an erygloid's magic acid doesn't affect several common mundane materials, specifically including teeth, glass, stone, and metal, which causes shards of these materials to accumulate inside an erygloid's body."

Erygloids are a mind-boggling and dire consequence of the combination of primal, arcane, and occult magic, forming blobs of rolling gunk and teeth-like shards that often incorporate real teeth. Erygloids consume magic, and they have tastes for specific magic and materials and aversions to others. Because of these affinities, erygloids can occasionally be found plugging up mechanisms and causing chaos in magical workshops and dungeons, sucking on local ley lines or sources of magic.

While no one knows for certain, there are several theories about the origins of erygloids. Some scholars claim that when fey die due to a deficiency of magic, they leave behind a liquid pool with their teeth, and those pools of residual energy seek out magic to absorb. Other scholars argue adamantly for an arcane or alchemical origin for erygloids, despite the fact that most mages would find an erygloid a nuisance. Still other scholars believe erygloids were created by powerful fey lords to eliminate magical accidents. In some communities, even more outlandish theories prevail, such as an extraplanetary origin based on a combination of interplanetary conjunction and faerie magic. Whatever the case, erygloids don't know or care about the truth of their own origin, as it has no effect on their lives.

Erygloids aren't usually predators who hunt down living creatures, since they derive nourishment from magic, not flesh. However, erygloids tend to hoard sources of magic to devour, such as magic items, and when adventurers disturb the items, the ooze inevitably emerges from hiding to violently protect its meal.

While spellcasters generally loathe erygloids due to the fey oozes' tendency to consume the magical energy spellcasters cherish, some eccentric mages appreciate a captured erygloid as a means to filter out undesired magical effects or to power traps meant to annoy rivals. Those who hate magic or have reason to worry about an assault by spellcasters sometimes employ erygloids as bodyguards, luring them with the promise of tasty magic treats.

## Oozing With Purpose

When erygloids gather in sufficient numbers, such as near ley lines or in the walls of arcane institutions, they become an erygloid colony. A colony allows them to combine their senses, expanding the range of their magic sense to hundreds of feet or even miles, depending on the area the colony covers. Once an individual separates from the colony, it loses its heightened senses, but this ability enables erygloids to find new places to explore. Erygloids also benefit from each other's experiences, improving their intelligence. Some colonies even learn to speak basic words. Such tricks can convince creatures to gift magic items to the voices in the walls in order to placate them.
