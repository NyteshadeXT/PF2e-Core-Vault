When some keyweed grow older and more cunning, they undergo a physical and mental chrysalis. Their fertility and ability to exude spores fade. These elder keyweeds seem to wind in on themselves, becoming more and more compact but poised to explode into action like a tightly wound spring.

Convolute keyweeds, as they're called, no longer have the biological imperative to mate, but the instinct to manipulate devices remains and, in fact, becomes even stronger. Convolutes vary in how they deal with this drive; many search for some kind of meaning to their existence.

Some convolutes find meaning in challenges, like seeking out ever more secure locations to penetrate or waging a competition with a rival, seeking to copy and exceed each other's exploits. Thieves' guilds often share ghost stories of accomplished members drawing the intense attention of a convolute.

Other convolutes become invested in causes. Whereas younger keyweeds tend to be quite naive about humanoid intrigues, convolutes throw themselves into complexity. They might go to elaborate lengths to mask their involvement. One story tells of a powerful crusading knight who had sworn not to lift her visor until an insidious conspiracy had been defeated. After the final raid on their stronghold, it turned out that a convolute had been puppeteering the armor from within.

* * *

Keyweeds are a family of diminutive plants who are known to perform quirky and unexpected activities, such as breaking into locks, swimming alongside other creatures, or even creating music to calm the spirits of the dead. The name refers to both the family as well as the most famous member of the family, the creature known as keyweed, a plant that loves to pick locks and disable devices.

While keyweeds' origin aren't entirely clear, many scholars have come to believe the most widely spread legends, which tell that keyweeds were created by druids to fulfill a variety of unusual niches where no other plants possibly could. Other theories exist, including those of some scholars who believe that keyweeds were originally humanoids who transformed into plants due to the blessing or curse of a deity of nature. For instance, one fairy tale parents tell to little children who are caught filching something is that if they misbehave and steal from others, the Green Man might come to the house at night and transform them into a keyweed, spiriting them away into the woods forever, never to see their families again.

Keyweeds have an unusual relationship with leshies based on their similarities and differences. Both are small sapient plant creatures, and if the stories are true, both originated from druidic magic, but leshies are nature spirits, or vitae, that directly incarnated in a mortal plant body through a primal ritual. While their progenitors might have been created by druids, keyweeds are mortal plants through and through, living, reproducing, and dying just like any other plant does.

## Convoluted Conspiracies

Unlike younger keyweeds, convolute keyweeds have a special love of complicated stories and plots (the more complex, the better), which can cause them to become involved in situations with a much broader scope than other keyweeds. They believe that this allows them to contort and exercise their minds' flexibility in the same way that they've been building up their bodies all along. As such, convolute keyweeds are also fans of puzzles, riddles, and brain teasers, as well as mystery stories. When unraveling a mystery or conspiracy, they think of themselves as traveling along the puzzle's body as if it were a winding plant, slowly getting to the root of the problem.
