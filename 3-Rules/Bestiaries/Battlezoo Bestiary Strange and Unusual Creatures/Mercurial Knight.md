Mercurial knights are adaptable constructs that can change between solid and liquid forms. According to legend, an ancient artificer, on a quest to create the perfect bodyguard, constructed the first mercurial knight out of pure quicksilver. Unable, or perhaps unwilling, to choose between a bulky knight and an agile fighter, the crafter attempted to make a guard capable of both, able to shift on a whim to better protect against possible intruders. Whether this invention was a stroke of genius or a sign of mercury-induced foolishness usually depends on which end of the knight's sword you find yourself on.

At first glance, a mercurial knight appears as a standard suit of armor, though slight ripples across its form hint at its true nature. Composed almost entirely of quicksilver, mercurial knights can will themselves to solidify, becoming imposing and stalwart defenders. In liquid form, a knight loses some protection but gains the speed and grace to make it a deadly combatant, and its liquid body is able to fit through the smallest crack. This allows for quick movement throughout the battlefield, either to confront intruders or to make a rapid escape.

In battle, a mercurial knight often confronts an intruder while in its solid form, using strong armor to deflect blows and soak up damage. When the time is right, it liquefies, providing the construct with a lithe form and powerful attacks to force the intruders back. Any party facing such a creation must approach with caution and employ smart tactics or risk being outmaneuvered by the perfect bodyguard.

## Volatile Allegiance

Mercurial knights may change who they consider to be allies on a whim. These decisions are sometimes based on who is winning, but other times they are inscrutable. As a result, they often end up stationed far from their masters during a fight.
