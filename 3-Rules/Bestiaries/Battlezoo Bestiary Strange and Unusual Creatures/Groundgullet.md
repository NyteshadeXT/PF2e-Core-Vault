    desc: "`pf2:3`  The groundgullet closes a thick membrane above its opening, which immediately matches the appearance of the surrounding terrain. It gains standard cover and attempts to Hide. If a Small or Medium creature moves into the groundgullet's space, it can use Swallow as normal. Otherwise, its cover can support up to 2 Bulk of unattended objects. Creatures with the Trap Finder feat or similar abilities gain the benefits against a groundgullet using Cover Pit."

    desc: "  A groundgullet's body is a 15-foot deep pit. It can Burrow through earthen material such that its opening remains on the surface. When it does, it visibly disturbs the earth along its path, turning it into difficult terrain. It can instead choose to Burrow at half Speed and leave no trail. A groundgullet can move through other creatures' spaces, and it can share the space of other Medium or smaller creatures."

  - name: "Spray"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The groundgullet sprays churned rock and stomach acid. It deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 acid damage to creatures in a 20-foot cone, with a DC 24 Reflex check save."

  - name: "Swallow"
    desc: "  **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Requirements** The groundgullet doesn't contain a creature inside it\n\n**Trigger** The groundgullet enters another creature's space or another creature enters the groundgullet's space\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature falls into the groundgullet. It can attempt to [[undefined]] (DC 26 Reflex check save); on a critical success, the creature can Step as part of the reaction, and if it does and leaves the groundgullet's space it doesn't fall. Creatures inside the groundgullet are forced to move along with it, and at the beginning of their turn they take 3d6+8 acid damage (DC 24 Fortitude check save) and are affected by Decomposing Belch. The groundgullet loses the cover granted by its Cover Pit ability when taking this action. While it has a creature swallowed, a groundgullet's opening must remain on the surface as it Burrows. A creature can Climb out of the groundgullet with a successful DC 26 Athletics check check, which they can reduce using rope or other tools; if they have a way to reach to the top of the 15-foot pit, they can simply pull themselves out with a single action, which has the move trait."

At first glance, a groundgullet might appear to be nothing more than a rank, slimy, and slightly red pit in the ground. In fact, its body is composed of membranes that make up the walls of the pit, which undulate as they slowly burrow through the ground. Inside, one finds muscular feelers, acidic glands, and a potent, decentralized nervous system. Groundgullets can seamlessly blend into their surroundings when covering their maw, making them dangerous ambush predators.

## Groundgullet Origins

The first groundgullets are believed to have been bred by an ancient cyclops kingdom as a bizarre means of garbage disposal, but a small number of the creatures have since spread to other regions around the world.

## Groundgullet Encounters

Though usually not cruel, some groundgullets have developed a predilection for human flesh and lurk outside settlements to feed on wanderers. When threatened, groundgullets pummel their assailants with volleys of debris, digestive acids, and the stench of their decomposing previous meals.
