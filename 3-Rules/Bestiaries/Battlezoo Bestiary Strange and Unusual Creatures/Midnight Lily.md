Midnight lilies are swarms of predatory plants that spend most of their time as an unremarkable, desiccated bramble. They flock together in gardens of four to five swarms of lilies, and under natural conditions, in the thickly canopied jungles where no light reaches the ground and the deep subterranean cave systems that a midnight lily calls home, the plants can go decades without so much as moving or consuming a meal. In these places where creatures have adapted to the darkness, midnight lilies hunt using light. When exposed to bright light, a midnight lily's pods blossom explosively into fleshy white flowers, each radiating from a single venomous needle-like thorn.

The plant then thrashes violently, seeking to inject its prey with venom. Once subjected to the strange magical cocktail that makes up a midnight lily's venom, a creature's insides begin to corrode and, more disturbingly, shed a sickly pale red light. This light can cause other lilies to blossom and result in a chain reaction feeding frenzy, ensuring that the plant can continue to move and sting. Once its prey succumbs to its injuries, a midnight lily plants its roots in the creature and

returns to its desiccated state to rest and feed. Creatures with darkvision who avoid the use of light have little to fear from midnight lilies. Because of this as well as their rare and beautiful flowers, midnight lilies are favorites of deep-dwelling gardeners and floriculturists. The plant is also used for deadly purposes, with wicked gardeners planting them in paths that a surface dweller might take to reach a subterranean lair or treasure horde, functioning as an early warning system.

## Living Maze

Some tunnel dwellers plant midnight lilies at strategic choke points to protect against intruders from the surface. Foes with darkvision who explore the maze-like lair may think they have it mapped out, only for others to wander in, trigger some lilies, and change the entire layout due to the plants moving into new positions. Defenders may also combine midnight lilies with snares that shed light so that even those with darkvision may fall victim to them.
