Kelpsteeds are curious, sapient plants with a drive to see the whole underwater world. They have relatively slight frames, however, and on their own they can't swim very fast. Kelpsteeds take their name from the way they overcome this: they like to form a partnership with a sturdier creature and provide it with the mobility to get to faraway marvels together.

Most scholars classify kelpsteeds into the same family of plant creatures as keyweeds (the eponymous "keyweed" family), another supposed creation of enterprising druids. According to legend, these druids needed a way to transport their allies from place to place during some ancient oceanic conflict, or so the theory goes. Marine druids still often partner with kelpsteeds, but kelpsteeds are free-willed and often bargain for something in return, such as a promise to travel to places the kelpsteed wishes to explore.

Kelpsteeds are seen as a mixed omen by sailors. While they can help one get around quickly underwater, they don't provide the ability to breathe. Grisly stories circulate of sailors being pulled down into the depths and drowning in the grip of young kelpsteeds who were just looking for a partner. This can be conflated with kelpies, malevolent plantlike horses that intentionally drown others. In more tropical waters, sailors have learned to swim with kelpsteeds much like dolphins, surfacing for deep breaths of air and then swiftly swimming on.

Kelpsteeds don't usually have separate communities of their own; they tend to keep company with a swimming partner. They're able to pick up scent trails from many miles away, indicating other kelpsteeds are in the area, and when they do, they often encourage their partners to rendezvous. For kelpsteeds, this is a time to meet new friends and mates and to swap stories. Kelpsteeds can live for many decades, and if someone learns a compatible sign language, they can often share lore covering a vast region.

Keyweeds are a family of diminutive plants who are known to perform quirky and unexpected activities, such as breaking into locks, swimming alongside other creatures, or even creating music to calm the spirits of the dead. The name refers to both the family as well as the most famous member of the family, the creature known as keyweed, a plant that loves to pick locks and disable devices.

While keyweeds' origin aren't entirely clear, many scholars have come to believe the most widely spread legends, which tell that keyweeds were created by druids to fulfill a variety of unusual niches where no other plants possibly could. Other theories exist, including those of some scholars who believe that keyweeds were originally humanoids who transformed into plants due to the blessing or curse of a deity of nature. For instance, one fairy tale parents tell to little children who are caught filching something is that if they misbehave and steal from others, the Green Man might come to the house at night and transform them into a keyweed, spiriting them away into the woods forever, never to see their families again.

Keyweeds have an unusual relationship with leshies based on their similarities and differences. Both are small sapient plant creatures, and if the stories are true, both originated from druidic magic, but leshies are nature spirits, or vitae, that directly incarnated in a mortal plant body through a primal ritual. While their progenitors might have been created by druids, keyweeds are mortal plants through and through, living, reproducing, and dying just like any other plant does.

## Kelpsteeds And Kelpies

Kelpsteeds are generally friendly, curious, and willing to make friends with anyone who wishes to swim with them. However, they hold a deep enmity for the malevolent equine fey known as kelpies. This hatred comes about because kelpies, which also have a plantlike appearance, use trickery and compulsion to fool their prey into riding in the water with them, only to drown and devour their victim. This leads to kelpsteeds being mistrusted—and even sometimes attacked—by potential new friends who mistake them for kelpies.
