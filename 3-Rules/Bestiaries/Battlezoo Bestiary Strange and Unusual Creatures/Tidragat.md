Tidragats, like other dragons, collect a hoard of treasure, though the contents of a tidragat's hoard are a little different than those of its larger brethren. Using its highly dextrous opposable front claws, a tidragat collects items that would be inconvenient to lose; the more inconvenient its loss would be, the more value the tidragat places on that particular item. Thus, their Hoard could contain the hair brush of a noble who prided themselves on their appearance or the water skins from an adventuring party that was about to head out into the wilderness.

Tidragats are usually smart enough to not take items that would be so inconvenient to lose that their victims are determined to track them down, except when it comes to items involving the art of wizardry. If there's a wand, scroll, or spellbook to steal, tidragats can't help themselves. Tidragats love playing with and learning how to use tools of wizardry, and most tidragats carry and use a few scrolls or a wand. A tidragat doesn't normally keep a spellbook of their own. Instead, they rely on spellbooks and scrolls that they've stolen from others to provide the knowledge needed to prepare their spells, so two tidragats will rarely have the same spells prepared.

## Scapegoat Entourage

Tidragats are popular with kobolds because their size makes kobolds feel closer to a true dragon. They also offer helpful advice to kobold warrens, improving their defensibility and the effectiveness of their members. In turn, tidragats task the kobolds with stealing risky items for them, giving them a degree of separation from any retribution that may result from the thefts.
