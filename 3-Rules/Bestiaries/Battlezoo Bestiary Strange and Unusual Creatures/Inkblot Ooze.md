Any creature within the area that can see the inkblot ooze must attempt a DC 22 Will check save. On a failure, the creature is [[undefined]] for 1d4 rounds, and on a critical failure they are also [[undefined]] for the same duration. At the end of this duration, or if a creature succeeds at its save, it is then temporarily immune to the aura for 1 minute."

    desc: "  Whenever an inkblot ooze makes a successful pseudopod Strike against a creature or unattended object, the inkblot ooze spills some of its form over a text within its reach, such as a book or scroll, in an attempt to ruin it. The text must be either the target of the Strike or on an object held or worn by the target. If the text is held or worn by a creature, that creature can attempt a DC 22 Reflex check save to protect the text. On a failure the text is covered in inky ooze, rendering it unusable. On a critical failure, or against an unattended object, in addition to the failure effects, a random spell, formula, or page within the text is permanently erased. A text ruined in this way can be recovered over the course of an hour with a successful DC 25 Crafting check check, and a spell or formula erased by a critical failure can be relearned for half its usual cost by using the page in the process."

It has an automatic result of 35 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as a regular feature of the book. It can't act except to dismiss the effect, either by using this ability again, or as a reaction to the book being opened. While [[undefined]] within a book, the inkblot ooze's Curious Symmetry aura is suppressed."

Thought to have first been created by the interactions between a spilled bottle of magical ink and an overstuffed spellbook, inkblot oozes are well known for being the bane of bookish types the world over due to their propensity for ruining entire libraries. Even in combat, an inkblot ooze tends to focus its attentions on whichever foe is carrying the most literature, a behavior that is theorized to be an attempt to propagate its kind by emulating its creation. When they can't find further texts to spoil, inkblot oozes are known to hibernate inside books and spring out of them once they are opened.

## The Inkblot Test

The inkblot test is a fairly well-known exam for determining if a person has thought disorders. The examiner presents images of ink on paper, often in symmetrical patterns, and asks the patient what the ink depicts. Not so well-known is the fact that the inkblot test was made up on the spot by an academic who was consulting a book infested by an inkblot ooze. The ooze leapt out of the book and danced in dizzying patterns before fleeing. Faced with the choice of losing a client due to damaged books or improvising a new test, the panicked doctor pretended to have planned the ooze's appearance and asked, "So how did that make you feel?"
