Ebirath is an enormous lobster, believed by some to be the incarnation of a lobster deity. Interestingly, lobsters do not die of old age. Usually, they die from being eaten or from growing too large to molt on their own. A particularly obsessed druid discovered this fact a few hundred years ago and was inspired to create an avatar of the ancient lobster deity, Ebirath, by continually helping a single lobster molt. Legends say that Ebirath was a betrayer god banished for attempting to flood the world so that aquatic ancestries, especially those with lobster qualities, could rule the world.

Presently, the druid's efforts have gained a whispered notoriety. A new sect of the ancient religion has sprouted around the new incarnation of Ebirath, and this sect has come to include other druids, sorcerers, and witches whose powers seemingly arise from this great crustacean.

Ebirath has developed the ability to telepathically communicate, possibly due to some divine influence from the original lobster deity. Ebirath prefers to spend its time in saltwater, and as such, the sect's hideaway is a repurposed aqueduct funneling ocean water to their patron.

## A Rivalry For The Ages

Ebirath is not the only unaging creature amassing worshipers. An ancient clam in a trench deep beneath the ocean waves has gathered an army of locathahs. Above water on another continent, a centuries-old tortoise senses Ebirath's apotheosis and commands its cabal to prepare for a possible confrontation. Conflict is not inevitable when young gods emergeâ€”perhaps they band together to form a new pantheon of giant sea creatures instead. The world waits with bated breath as they inch toward confrontation. At their current rate of travel, the world will be waiting a long time, but that matters not to these immortals.
