  - name: "Positive Healing"
    desc: "  Unlike other skeletons, living bones draw health from positive energy. Despite being spirits, they are living creatures, which means they're healed by positive healing effects, they aren't destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points, and they're damaged by negative damage and not healed by effects that would normally heal undead (like a champion's touch of corruption)."

    desc: " (aura,divine,emotion,vitality) 20 feet. Living bones have a glow about them that radiates a positive attitude and soothes the mind of others with a wide, toothy smile. As long as the living bones takes no hostile actions, it exudes a peaceful aura. Creatures in the aura who attempt a hostile action must attempt a DC 17 Will check save. A creature who succeeds on their saving throw is temporarily immune for 1 minute; otherwise, they don't take the action against the living bones and the action is wasted, but they can attempt the saving throw again by spending more actions. If the living bones takes a hostile action, the soothing glow deactivates for 1 minute, allowing others to attack them with ease."

  - name: "Merciful Strikes"
    desc: " (divine) Living bones' attacks are surrounded by a nimbus of positive energy. Their Strikes deal an extra 1 vitality damage, as the positive energy that animates them is not fully contained. As normal for positive damage, this harms only undead and other creatures with negative healing. Additionally, living bones can make nonlethal attacks without taking the usual â€“2 circumstance penalty."

Once in a long while, when a skeleton comes in contact with positive energy, instead of being damaged or destroyed, they are transformed. The negative energy that animates them and feeds their hatred is almost completely extinguished and replaced with positive energy, creating something that shouldn't be possible. For mindless undead, it can even create a mind and soul where there was none. However, this state is not entirely stable, as the remaining negative energy within them constantly tries to overwhelm its counterpart. As such, exposure to significant quantities of negative energy is extremely harmful to living bones.

There is lively debate in the more obscure academic circles on whether or not an undead animated by positive energy is technically still an undead, but this changes little for the individuals in question. They still retain their previous bony visage with a warm glow around them, which makes interaction with other people rather complicated. But this doesn't cloud their sunny disposition, and they toil restlessly to help wherever they can. Their calm and positive attitude gives them a chance to integrate into smaller communities in remote areas, but that is by no means guaranteed. The ones who succeed in joining a community almost inevitably choose more peaceful professions, becoming farmers, artisans, or healers despite their martial capabilities.

The presented statistics represent a skeletal champion that was transformed, but theoretically any type of skeleton (or potentially other undead) can be affected. This is an extremely rare occurrence, though.

## Of Two Worlds

Regular skeletons don't respond with as much animosity toward living bones as they do toward other living creatures. Living bones who have a hard time being accepted into societies may form their own communities on the borders of regions with undead activity, settling in places the living wouldn't dare and providing early warnings of undead incursions. Such communities may even include animal living bones.
