When an insurrection against a demon lord fails, its leader could face several destinies. The three most common of these are a life of servitude to one they tried to overthrow, the complete and utter destruction of oblivion, or a lifetime of torture at the hands of the most sadistic followers of the demon lord. But sometimes, a more creative and humiliating punishment is in order. And so, the demon insurgent's powerful and violent soul is trapped inside one of the weakest and most peaceful creatures in the Material Plane, a sheep. However, when the hatred and desire for destruction of the trapped demon's soul are strong enough, over time the demon completely takes over the sheep. Even in this case, the close bond developed between the demon and its host creature simply becomes the last part of their punishment. The freed demon becomes a demon shepherd, a fusion of the almighty power they once held, the fear the sheep feels, and the instinct to live in a flock.

In this twisted transformation of both body and mind, the demon shepherd acquires a strange obsession to guide and protect other demons transformed into sheep, especially those that were part of the same insurrection the demon shepherd once led. Consequently, the demon shepherd channels their thirst for destruction toward feeding their flock with the corpses of creatures from the Material Plane.

## Baaaad Hair Day

Demon or not, a sheep's wool is going to grow and continue to grow. Talented shearers with steady hands may find themselves adopted by a demon shepherd against their will. In exchange for their indentured servitude, they are gifted protection and the heads of those who have wronged them in life.
