Telepathic earwigs resemble tiny brown insects with long antennae and pincers on their abdomens. Unable to reproduce on their own, these earwigs have developed a unique life cycle: they insert themselves into a host's body, use their telepathic powers to control the mind of their host, and then begin the process of using the creature to incubate new earwigs. Throughout the gestation, they mentally control the host in order to create a suitable living and reproductive environment. The young earwigs continue to live within the host, taking over its actions and keeping it alive until it is no longer useful. They will use the host to defend themselves if required, but by using their keen intellect and ability to read the host's mind, they are often able to avoid danger and suspicion. When the host outlives their usefulness, the earwigs eject from its body violently, exploding from the host's brain as a new swarm. Telepathic earwigs have learned to use their telepathy to link their minds together when not inside a host, which has the effect of boosting their telepathic powers and allowing them to cast occult spells. Fighting a telepathic earwig swarm isn't necessarily about destroying every single earwig, but instead more about disconnecting the hivemind enough that they can no longer amplify each other's latent telepathic abilities, thereby becoming nothing more than regular earwigs.

## Ear Today, Gone Tomorrow

The name earwig comes from the popular belief that the creatures crawl into people's ears to lay their eggs. Earmuffs and ear plugs are no defense against the telepathic earwig swarm, though. Their eggs can enter the body anywhere, with their telepathic abilities coaxing the body to let down its defenses and absorb their offspring. Not all infestations are lethal, however. A strong enough blast of psychic energy can cause a swarm to exit the host prematurely, in which case they do pour out of the ears in their rush to escape the mental damage.
