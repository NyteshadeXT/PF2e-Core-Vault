The spellfilcher chooses a spell prepared by the creature or in the repertoire of that creature. If the spell was prepared, the creature must attempt a DC 22 Will check save or lose that prepared spell. If the creature casts spells spontaneously, it must attempt a DC 22 Will check save or lose a spell slot of the appropriate level. The spellfilcher can only steal a 1st or 2nd level spell this way. A spellfilcher can store up to three stolen 1st-level spells and three stolen 2nd-level spells at the same time. A spellfilcher can't steal cantrips."

Spellfilchers are a small type of fey that delight in mischief. They seem to have an innate understanding of which minor magics would be missed the most if they were gone. Spellfilchers claim to be born out of the jealousy of the magically inept for more skilled magicians. If this is true, it means that more powerful spellfilchers likely exist, which would be capable of stealing more powerful magic.

Spellfilchers are tiny creatures that possess the upper half of a colorful dragon that carries a tiny wand, while their lower halves trail off into sparks of mystical energies.

Spellfilchers treasure their wands. They can replace a lost or stolen wand with one day of work, but they are loathe to do so and bargain dearly to get back a wand that belongs to them.

## Stealing From A Thief

The spellfilcher's fae wand only works for the spellfilcher, so creatures who take one cannot use it to steal spells. However, if the spellfilcher stole a spell and has not cast it yet, the wand functions as a scroll of that spell at the appropriate level and crumbles to dust after casting the spell. Destroying a wand in this way greatly upsets the spellfilcher, so bargaining with it is usually more advantageous.
