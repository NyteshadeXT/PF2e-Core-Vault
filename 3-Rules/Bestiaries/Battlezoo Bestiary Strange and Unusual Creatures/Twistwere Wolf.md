When one thinks of werecreatures, the mind's eye typically goes to those humanoids doomed to transform into animals and their vicious animal- humanoid hybrid shapes beneath the full moon, cursed to rampage through their own communities. Recently, though, this primal curse made a subtle but startling zoonotic jump from humanoids to animals, resulting in shapechanging beasts called twistweres.

A twistwere's animal form can be of any size and only affects animals. The first known creatures of this kind were house cats, songbirds, and small rodents, but later it was said that dogs, livestock, and wild animals had been seen as well. While in their animal form, twistweres behave as perfectly normal animals of their type, that is, until the light of the full moon shines upon them. Twistweres can pass on their curse to their offspring, or they can transmit the curse through their bite. As with other true werecreatures, those born with the curse have full control over their shapechanging abilities except during a full moon, when the transformation is irresistible, though they typically only transform by choice when their lives are in danger.

In hybrid form, a twistwere appears as a stretched-out and distorted version of their animal form, with muscular bulges and elongated appendages that drive fear into the hearts of any who are unfortunate enough to fall prey to their uncontrollable rage.
