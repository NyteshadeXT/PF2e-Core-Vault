    desc: "  The feth velaunt is as much a curse as it is a creature, and the way it fades back and forth between the two aspects of itself makes it significantly harder to harm it. Whenever a Strike would hit the feth velaunt, the attacking creature must attempt a DC 9 Flat check. On a failure, the Strike phases through the feth velaunt and misses. Afterwards, regardless of the result of the flat check, the DC decreases by 2. This reduction is cumulative, and once the flat check DC reaches 1, creatures no longer need to attempt it when they hit the feth velaunt with a Strike. At the beginning of the feth velaunt's turn, the flat check DC resets to 9."

  - name: "Tether"
    desc: "  If the feth velaunt hits a creature with its tether lash, that creature becomes [[undefined]] by the feth velaunt ([[undefined]] DC 30). Unlike normal for the grabbed condition, a creature grabbed by a feth velaunt isn't [[undefined]], though it can't move outside of the tether's reach. A creature can sever the tether by attacking the tether, which has an AC of 20, and dealing at least 15 slashing damage. If the feth velaunt attempts to move in a way that would exceed the reach of any tether, creatures attached to those tethers can attempt an Escape action as a reaction. If they fail to Escape, or don't attempt to Escape, such creatures are dragged along with the feth velaunt at a distance equal to the tether's reach. This is forced movement. The reach of all current tethers decreases by 15 feet at the start of the feth velaunt's turn each round, dragging all tethered creatures towards it if the reach becomes less than the distance between the creature and feth velaunt. If a tether's reach reaches 0 in this way, the tethered creature becomes [[undefined]]. Creatures who are restrained in this way are moved along with the feth velaunt when it moves. Each time the feth velaunt takes damage, all creatures currently tethered take 1d4 mental damage; this damaging effect has the nonlethal trait."

  - name: "Harvest"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The feth velaunt unleashes a barrage of tether lashes in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area of the barrage must attempt a DC 28 Reflex check saving throw. On a failure, they're tethered and take 4d8 bludgeoning damage, and on a critical failure, they take double damage and are affected by tether. The feth velaunt can't Harvest again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Mind Crush"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (nonlethal) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The feth velaunt sends a wave of psychic energy to crush the minds of the victims attached to its tethers. Each creature tethered by the feth velaunt takes 6d6 mental damage with a DC 25 Will check save. Creatures [[undefined]] by the tether treat the result of their saving throw as one degree of success worse than they rolled."

A feth velaunt is both a creature and a curse, appearing as a transparent eel-like creature with an ophidian head and hard, oversized fins. It grows and absorbs bodies until it can threaten an entire small settlement on its own.

A feth velaunt forms when a curse afflicts the local dead, causing them to lose all their color and opacity before crawling out of their grave to wander into the ocean. Worse, under the waves, the bodies of the dead merge together, forming a creature of singular desire: to continue growing.

## Feth Velaunt Finales

Eventually, the citizenry discovers the grisly parade of mindless, transparent bodies, or there aren't enough corpses to sustain growth. That's when it surfaces. Long and eel-like, transparent as fine glass, the creature drags itself onto land with its fins. Its belly is a miasma of coiling, whipping tendrils. It tethers dozens of creatures and tucks them up under its belly. Then, it slips back underwater so that its gathered victims dreamlessly drown. While these statistics are perfect for a newly arisen feth velaunt, with enough time and bodies, it could become a gargantuan creature capable of destroying cities.
