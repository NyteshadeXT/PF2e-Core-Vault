    desc: "  Though the testudan revels in its strength and power, it fears those who are more powerful than it.

On a critical failure, it becomes [[undefined]], takes 8d6 mental damage, and is [[undefined]] for 1 round. It is then temporarily immune to Always Someone Better for 1 minute."

Regardless of the result, the creature is moved out of the testudan's space to the closest empty space.

A testudan is a massive chimera with faint relations to dragons, with the head of a lion, six bear-like feet, the back of a turtle, and the tail of a serpent. These creatures tend to be solitary, never mingling even with members of their own kind except during mating season. Brash and ornery, the average testudan spends its time bullying smaller creatures and attacking small towns until an army or group of adventurers show up to send it running with its tail between all six of its legs.

## Testy About Tresses

Making a testudan retreat does not always require besting it with a display of strength. It is also possible to strike at its pride. Some towns have reported success hiring a thief to shave off an offending testudan's mane in the dead of night, perhaps with the assistance of a mage with the sleep spell to make doubly sure it does not interrupt the process. The creature, horrified by its crudely shorn locks, hides until it feels it can show its face again.
