Up to two other creatures within 15 feet of the target take 2d6 negative and 2d6 mental damage, with a DC 22 Will check save."

  - name: "Hole in the World"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate,void) The susurration releases a wave of negative energy. All creatures in the susurration's voice thief aura take 3d8 void damage with a basic DC 22 Fortitude check save. A creature that fails this save is also Sickened 1, and one that critically fails is Sickened 2. As long as the susurration isn't Grabbed or Restrained, it can then choose to teleport up to 20 feet away. This movement is a teleportation effect; it doesn't trigger reactions and isn't impacted by difficult terrain or obstacles. The susurration can't use Hole in the World again for 1d4 rounds."

Formed as a mass of disembodied humanoid tongues, a susurration floats a few feet off the ground, lazily swirling as if caught in the eddy of a quiet river. Something lies at the heart of the tongues, but it can't be clearly seen, and since it disappears when the creature is destroyed, only the original creator knows what's there. Silence emanates forcefully from the susurration, blanketing the nearby area in almost complete soundlessness. Behind the silence, however, is an inaudible but noticeable hint of endless, sorrowful whispering. Dark, frigid tendrils of undeath lance out from within the writhing mass.

Reclusive spellcasters, often those pursuing lichdom or even viler paths to power, find themselves warding their towers or lairs against potential intruders. While many build up a host of guardians with common and successful minions like mimics or skeletal warriors, only the most talented and paranoid overlords would animate a susurration into existence.

Whatever magic animates a susurration is a closely guarded secret, though over the years theories have risen to the surface. Did the tongues belong to talented sorcerers? Faithless heretics? People exceptional at channeling the power of the world through their songs? Others have mused quietly if perhaps they were donated willingly to the creator's cause, perhaps from some secret cult of silence and horror that removed their own tongues for the foul ritual of animation.

However it might have come to be, the magic driving a susurration imbues it with a mindless duty to defend. It waits for decades on end in a dusty heap until living creatures enter its designated territory. The only creatures safe from this calculated, unbending malice are other undead. The living are not welcome within the reach of a susurration.

## Tongue In Cheek

When destroyed, a susurration simply falls apart into a pile of tongues. Age and decay catch up with the tongues based on how long the susurration has existedâ€”ancient ones may have the tongues crumble to dust, while younger ones result in a rain of tongues flopping to the ground. For whatever reason, multiple adventurers have succumbed to the temptation of putting one of the tongues in their own mouths. The disembodied tongue springs to life, dissolving the fool's original one and replacing it. The host becomes unable to vocalize any sounds ever again but suffers no other ill effects.
