If a fascinated creature is adjacent to the golden coinivore swarm, it stays still and doesn't act. If attacked by the golden coinivore swarm, the creature is freed from the fascination at the end of the golden coinivore swarm's turn. Otherwise, the fascination lasts 1 minute, and hostile actions against the fascinated creature and its allies don't end the fascination early.\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the golden coinivore swarm, the creature can attempt a new save against the fascination at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the golden coinivore swarm's turn."

This deadly guardian is composed of thousands of hungry maws masquerading as a tremendous wealth of golden coins.

A golden coinivore swarm can lie dormant for months on end, waiting for prey to stumble upon them. Their beguiling appearance, slowing poison, and endless tearing teeth then make short work of any fleshy morsel they can catch. This hunger makes a golden coinivore swarm difficult to keep alongside other creatures, as they invariably turn upon their companions. The swarm only ignores other coinivores and beings without edible flesh, such as most constructs, oozes, and spirits. Thankfully, golden coinivore swarms are extremely territorial and usually don't willingly venture far from whatever lair they have come to call home.

Anyone who survives an encounter with a golden coinivore swarm, however, might later discover a few extra coins in their pockets and purse, as a very small number of nascent coinivore queens in each swarm seek not blood but a home for a new brood. In this way, coinivores have been slowly spreading to the most unexpected of places.

It should be noted, though, that an individual coinivore drone, once separated from its swarm, becomes rather docile, and they have been kept by some as unconventional pets or even familiars.

## Say Hello To My Little Friends

Some thieves guilds keep golden coinivore swarms for both defensive and offensive purposes. They place the creatures inside false entrances to their vaults, where they ambush rivals who think they are easy pickings. They may also use them to pay debts, unleashing murder on foes foolish enough to accept the bags of gold. Legend speaks of one ambitious thief who gifted a swarm to a dragon. It did not kill the dragon but infested the hoard so thoroughly that the dragon abandoned it in disgust, leaving easy pickings for the thief.
