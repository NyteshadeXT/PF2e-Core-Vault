    desc: " (emotion,mental) The remnant is unable to resist a good challenge, especially one delivered dramatically. Any creature can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to challenge the remnant to focus on them, which the remnant happily accepts. Until the end of the remnant's next turn, or until another creature takes an action to gain the remnant's attention, the remnant takes offensive actions against only that creature."

  - name: "Hype Aura"
    desc: " (aura,emotion,mental) 30 feet. A bloodsport remnant relishes escalating battles to a climactic finish and it infuses those nearby with the hype to deal more damage but the brazenness to expose themselves to attacks. When the remnant takes its first turn in combat, all creatures in the aura, enemy, ally, and the remnant alike, gain a +1 status bonus to damage rolls and are [[undefined]]. The status bonus to damage rolls increases by +1 for every round the remnant fights, to a maximum of +4 after 4 rounds. If the remnant is destroyed or the fight ends, the benefits reset and fade away."

It attempts a Performance check against the creature's Perception DC, with the following effects.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is filled with dread that even their most powerful attack was ineffective. It becomes [[undefined]].\n\n**Success** As critical success, but it becomes [[undefined]].\n\n**Failure** The creature realizes the critical hit was effective; it's unaffected and is temporarily immune to No-Sell for 24 hours."

That creature takes damage from the bloodsport remnant's fist Strike with a DC 28 Reflex check save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature stops the remnant's movement before the remnant enters its space, and the creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure**, The creature takes double damage and is knocked [[undefined]]."

  - name: "Mighty Leap"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The bloodsport remnant takes to the sky with a powerful jump, Leaping up to its Speed in any direction, even straight up. At any point during this movement it can take a single Strike or [[undefined]] action against a creature in its reach. If it chooses to Grapple and succeeds, it must halt its [[undefined]] without moving away or the [[undefined]] condition ends, as normal for the grabbed condition."

Born from the broken bodies and indomitable spirits of pit fighters, gladiators, and brawlers, bloodsport remnants are creatures that thrive on violence. Fueled by the cheers of a crowd only they can hear, they wander the world searching for challengers capable of lasting long enough in a fight to put on a good show.

A remnant has no preference regarding how many participants it pulls into a battle, sometimes even wandering into the middle of an active battlefield and challenging all creatures it can see. Its presence riles nearby creatures into a frenzy of violence and adrenaline, pushing both it and its chosen enemies to greater heights than they can normally achieve. No battle with a Bloodsport Remnant lasts very long, as the fights become more and more brutal with every passing second.

Though the remnant retains no memories from the beings whose lives gave it unlife, the bloody, flashy combat that birthed it imprinted a natural flair for the dramatic and an innate respect for any who match its style. Against such foes, a bloodsport remnant joyfully plays along with any posturing boasts.

## Are You Not Entertained?

The flair and drama of bloodsport remnants cause them to gain admirers. The longest lasting remnants earn nicknames and devoted followings based on their style and personality. An enterprising organization called the Worldwide Wagers Exchange employs trackers to follow remnants and report on their activities, allowing people to bet on what the remnants will do next and how they will fare.
