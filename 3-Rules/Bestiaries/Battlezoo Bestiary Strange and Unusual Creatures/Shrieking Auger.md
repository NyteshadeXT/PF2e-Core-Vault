If a creature to which the shrieking auger is attached is [[undefined]] from the keening shriek, the shrieking auger controls the direction it flees.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[undefined]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[undefined]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is fleeing for 1 round, [[undefined]] and [[undefined]].

This agile furred quadruped might be confused for a small bear cub if not for the screw-like horn in place of where its head should be, but despite their surprisingly cuddly appearance, shrieking augers are terrifying ambush predators capable of taking down and slowly consuming creatures many times their size.

A shrieking auger is an incredibly patient hunter; it's perfectly willing to lie in wait for hours before springing with great speed towards its prey. It scurries over its victim's body, then spins rapidly to drill its horn into the victim's flesh. In order to prevent removal as it continues to burrow, the shrieking auger rubs together specialized tines that run along its paws, creating a dreadful shrieking noise that strikes fear into all but the most stalwart. As the victim tries to flee, the shrieking auger twists and tugs to direct its steps away from friends and allies.

Shrieking augers are undiscerning carnivores with broad palates. Regardless of their prey's flavor and consistency, a shrieking augur eventually grinds their victims down to the pulpy consistency needed to suck the remains in through the fourteen tiny mouth openings at the tip of their horn.

Shrieking augers generally live laid-back nomadic lives, settling only long enough within the carcass of a creature they've slain to eat their fill before moving on in simple-minded pursuit of the next meal. They are all but impossible to befriend or train, though some enterprising individuals have certainly tried.

## This Hole Was Made For Me

Shrieking augers can also drill into earth or rock, leaving behind a perfectly circular entrance for curious creatures to investigate. These tunnels are not homes for the nomadic creatures, instead serving as temporary shelters to flee danger or as a way to find water. Should a poor soul peer into a tunnel while it is still occupied, however, the shrieking auger bursts out, thrilled to find a meal delivering itself. Augers who experience such encounters a few times may then start drilling holes as an ambush hunting strategy.
