Despite the name bestowed upon them by hunters who quake at the sight of the rows of razor-sharp triangular teeth, emperor shark penguins are not descended from any actual shark but are instead aberrant penguins cross-mutated with sea devils. First created by ice witches to defend their frozen domain against intruders, these warped aberrations are the evolved result of a single experiment to cross a penguin, a flightless bird that forms deep social bonds to survive its harsh icy environment, with a sea devil, a bloodthirsty, shark-toothed amphibious humanoid.

With their crueler and more barbarous mutations becoming more and more pronounced in subsequent generations, emperor shark penguins today are ruthless marauders with short tempers and beaks lined with rows of teeth. Growing to a similar height and heft as an adult dwarf, the penguins form regimented rookeries that blockade narrow ice floes along caravan corridors. When merchants and other caravanners send hunters to eradicate these blockades, the penguins take pleasure in working together to extract their toll in blood. They have also been observed hauling themselves out of the water to swarm such apex predators of frozen coastlines as polar bears and even frost worms.

Using their powerful swim flippers to launch themselves out of the water, emperor shark penguins slide across the ice on their bellies, pop to their feet, and unleash a flurry of grievous bites before their prey can even recognize the blitz. Despite their ability to attack in concert to bring down powerful foes, humanoid or otherwise, emperor shark penguins attack larger creatures only for brutal sport and abandon their kills to other scavengers; they instead subsist on a diet of bait fish.

While the current dominant form of emperor shark penguin is thought to be incapable of speech, adventurers returning bloodied to ice fishing lodges have reported tales of sadistic, intelligent-sounding laughter shared among bands of marauding penguins, and it's not inconceivable that a rookery in some remote corner of the world is on the verge of adding language to its toolkit.

## An Armless Arms Race

Sea devils, who did not take kindly to ice witches experimenting on them, retaliated by creating their own breed of toothy hunters to eradicate emperor shark penguins. Thus the leopard shark seal came into existence. The ice witches then crossed sharks with sea devils, giving them the ability to breathe air, thus birthing the devil shark. And then the sea devils retaliated again and created the giant shark squid. Thankfully, the introduction of so many predators caused an ecosystem collapse before killer shark whales came about, and all the new aberrations starved to death, leaving the world with just the emperor shark penguins once more.
