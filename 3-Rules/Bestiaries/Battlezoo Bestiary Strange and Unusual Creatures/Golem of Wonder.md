    desc: "  harmed by lawful and sonic (5d10 damage, 2d8 damage from areas or persistent damage); healed by chaotic (area 2d8 Hit Points); slowed by divination\n* * *\n\nA golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem's stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as \"cold and water\"), either type of spell can affect the golem.\n\n*   **Harmed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Healed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Slowed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it's slowed 1 for that round.\n*   **Vulnerable To** Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block."

  - name: "Invoke Wonder"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The golem points its finger at a target within 60 feet and unleashes the chaotic magic upon which it was built. Roll a d20 on the following table to determine the effect. Targets only receive a saving throw if the effect calls for it. Any DC required is 30.\n\n**1:** Roll twice, targeting different creatures within range each time. Ignore any further results of 1 on these rolls.\n\n**2–3:** Large glass beads form on the target's arms, weighing them down. They are [[undefined]] until they take a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to break the beads.\n\n**4–5:** The target switches places with another random creature within 30 feet of the golem.\n\n**6–8:** The target's mind is overwhelmed by the chaos, causing them to become [[undefined]] for 1 minute. They can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt a DC 30 Will check save. On a success, the stupefied condition ends early.\n\n**9–11:** The golem casts _[[Spells/Solid Fog|Solid Fog]]_. Roll 1d4. On a 1 or 2, the fog is centered on the golem, and on a 3 or 4, it's centered on the target.\n\n**12–13:** The golem is [[undefined]] for 3 rounds. It can only use the additional action to Invoke Wonder.\n\n**14–15:** The golem casts _[[Spells/Slow|Slow]]_ (DC 30 Fortitude check) on the target.\n\n**16–17:** The target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude check save or their limbs temporarily lengthen for 2 rounds. For the duration, their reach increases to 10 feet if it's shorter, but they are [[undefined]].\n\n**18–19:** All the target's nonmagical items, including any clothing, glow with a harmless blue light for 10 minutes. This casts dim light in a 10 foot radius and can't be extinguished.\n\n**20:** 10d6 pebbles shoot from the golem of wonder's hand, doing the same amount of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line in the direction of the target, with a DC 30 Reflex check save."

_Rods of wonder_ and related artifacts have long captured the imagination of artificers and spellcasters. So, it was all but inevitable that someone would imbue a magical creature with the chaotic magic found in these curious items.

These brightly colored and bejeweled constructs are feared, not because of any expert spellcasting or massive damage, but because it is so hard to prepare for them. Their attacks are based on chaos and randomness, making it virtually impossible to guess what they will do next. This unpredictability makes a golem of wonder a formidable foe.

## Wondering Why

Like most artifacts, golems of wonder are so difficult and expensive to construct that their makers are left pondering what purposes they could serve that would be more valuable than the golem itself. They are less consistent guardians than their more lethal counterparts, and they have additional weaknesses to sensory magic. A few have ended up at casinos, where their scintillating appearances and chaotic abilities allow them to double as both an attraction as well as security.
