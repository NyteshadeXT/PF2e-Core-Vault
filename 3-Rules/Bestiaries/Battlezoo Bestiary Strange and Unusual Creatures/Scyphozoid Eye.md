    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature targets the scyphozoid eye with an attack\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The scyphozoid eye moves its arms randomly to disorient its foes. It gains the benefits of the [[undefined]] condition against the triggering attack. If the triggering attack was a melee attack and it fails to hit because of the flat check for the concealed condition, the arms snag the weapon or unarmed attack, and the creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to further attacks with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn. The timing of the arms' movement is harder to predict for ranged attackers, so the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks from Whirling Arms increases from DC 5 to DC 7 Flat check."

Scyphozoid eyes are the pinnacle evolution of the drifting parasites from some unknown realm that fuse with victims' bodies to form bell walkers.

Visually, a scyphozoid eye resembles a massive jellyfish with almost completely transparent rubbery skin. Four massive oral arms and multiple thinner tentacles hang in the air, emerging from under its hood and surrounding its mouth. The function of these arms is to melt any source of nourishment within their reach, while the thinner tentacles deliver a deadly toxin to the scyphozoid eye's victims. Floating inside of the hood and constantly moving, a giant eye glows brightly with multiple colorful patterns. This eye contains the creature's core, akin to its brain.

When the scyphozoid eye uses magic, an entrancing sequence of colorful waves reflects from the normally transparent skin. These colors allow the scyphozoid eye to mentally manipulate its targets and launch powerful rays with dangerous effects.

As a lost being from its original, unknown home, a scyphozoid eye consumes sources of occult magic with the goal of finding its way back. If a scyphozoid eye were ever to succeed, however, it would open a rift, allowing a massive invasion of blight parasites to occur.

## Knock, Knock

The scyphozoid eye's search for a way home results in it being attracted to portals and teleportation magic. Those seeking to use permanent instances of teleportation magic, such as teleportation circles or doorways between planes, must always be wary of a scyphozoid eye lurking nearby or on the other side of a portal.
