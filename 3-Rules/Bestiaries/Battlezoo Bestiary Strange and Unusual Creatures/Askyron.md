Askyron are frightening harbingers of the end times, powerful entities meant to break down the gods themselves in the final unmaking of reality. Or at least they were in the previous incarnation of reality. Now that their job is done and has been since long before the beginning of this reality, they're the cosmic equivalent of guests who've stayed after the party is over.

Askyron didn't intend to stay around, but while most of their number returned to whatever realm they call home or dissipated back into nothingness, a small number lingered. They found themselves perplexed by this strange new reality that's come together, distorting themselves into new forms that suit its laws of physics so they can safely exist. Now that they aren't responsible for ending everything one day, their professional menace has given way to a far more relaxed attitude. Most are akin to tourists or doting grandparents examining the drawings of a beloved child as they wander and take in the sights. Some may take up roles as sages or tyrants, though they are ill-fitted for both given their lack of understanding of this reality's morality.

Askyron have a one-sided antagonism with the aeons. Aeons view Askyron as outside elements that threaten the systems they preserve and attempt to destroy such elements without mercy. Askyron themselves don't quite understand what this system is that aeons prize so dearly, but they find it precious that aeons care so much for it.

## Ask Yron

An askyron once visited a carnival where people took its name too literally. Now the carnival makes most of its money "translating" the askyron's ramblings for those who flock to hear its wisdom.
