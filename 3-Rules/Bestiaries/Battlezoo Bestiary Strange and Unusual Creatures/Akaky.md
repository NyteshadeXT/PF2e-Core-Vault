    desc: " (divine) When an akaky is destroyed, it reforms, fully healed, at the location where its clothing was stolen after 2d4 days. If someone willingly gives at least a piece of its original garment to the akaky, it is permanently destroyed."

  - name: "Winter Aura"
    desc: " (aura,cold) 10 feet. The air grows supernaturally colder in close proximity to an akaky, causing the temperature to become two steps colder. Mild cold becomes extreme cold, Severe or extreme cold becomes incredible cold and so on. As long as this brings the temperature to severe cold or colder, creatures other than the akaky who end their turn in the aura who aren't wearing winter clothing take 1d4 cold damage, with a DC 17 Fortitude check save."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Ghostly Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  As Grab, but the akaky can Grab a corporeal creature despite being incorporeal itself. It is only able to do so by manifesting a fading image of a ghostly overcoat onto the creature and then clutching onto the incorporeal coat. This spiritual garment superimposes over any winter clothing a target might have, allowing the akaky to potentially tear the warm clothing off the victim after killing them. The [[undefined]] DC for victims of an akaky's Grab is 20, rather than the akaky's Athletics DC.\n\n* * *\n"

  - name: "Steal Coat"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The akaky has a creature [[undefined]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The akaky rips the ghostly overcoat off and fills the target with the freezing cold of a fierce winter night. The target takes 1d8+6 cold damage, with a DC 20 Fortitude check save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** Target takes half damage but its coat remains secure.\n\n**Failure** Target takes full damage. If the target was wearing winter clothing, the clothing phases off their body along with the superimposed ghostly overcoat and falls to the ground in the target's space. Because the akaky is only able to grab the coat, not the creature directly, this causes the creature's grabbed condition to end, though it doesn't stop the akaky from using its Ghostly Grab ability again later to manifest a new coat.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[undefined]] and [[undefined]] until it spends 10 minutes in a warm environment."

  - name: "Jealous Hatred"
    desc: "  An akaky gains +2 circumstance bonus to all its attack rolls against targets wearing winter clothing, but its hatred for such creatures is also ultimately its undoing. Strikes made by creature wearing winter clothing are treated as magical when attacking the akaky."

  - 1: Akaky

Akakys are the souls of mortals who died from hypothermia or illness, typically after they were ambushed and robbed of their valuables and, more importantly, their warm clothes during the winter.

These spirits, filled with unspeakable hatred for the living and jealousy for their warmth, stalk city streets in the dead of cold winter nights, only to unleash a spectral phantasm of their own suffering upon anyone unlucky enough to cross their path.

## Cold Comfort

City dwellers share rumors about how to survive akaky encounters whenever the chill of winter approaches. Some say dropping a doll wearing winter clothing will distract an akaky, while others say the smell of roasted marshmallows repels akakys or that fire will slow down an approaching akaky. Nobody's exactly sure as to why, to date, none of this advice has actually worked.
