Oil Creatures have the following statistics: 10 HP, 15 AC, and a melee pseudopod unarmed attack with an attack roll modifier of +9 that deals 1d6+1 bludgeoning damage. For any other modifier or DC, oil creatures use the paintbrush fox's value. Each turn after the first, the paintbrush fox must spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to mentally command the oil creature or it collapses into ink, though unlike most minions, the oil creature gains three actions. After 10 minutes, or after the paintbrush fox spends a turn without commanding its oil creature, the oil creature dissolves into a useless black puddle."

A paintbrush fox appears as a normal fox, but their silver fur is marred by a black oil that profusely drips from their tail. The oil produced by a paintbrush fox is deep black and clings to almost any surface it contacts. By channeling primal magic through their oil, a paintbrush fox can form solid shapes that can emulate creatures the paintbrush fox has previously observed. The fox can command these oil creatures, giving an additional ally in times of distress or a simple companion in times of boredom. If forced to fight, paintbrush foxes generally ambush prey, using an oily ally to distract and defend.

After maturing, a fox leaves their family den and ventures off to claim their own territory in a forest or vegetated plain. Paintbrush foxes have a strange habit of drawing designs and figures on trees and other objects in order to mark their territory, though a creature that enters a paintbrush fox's turf is usually safe from harm as long as it doesn't damage or usurp it. While paintbrush foxes generally prefer to remain isolated, they adore observing travelers that pass through their territory. They even mimic the peculiar mannerisms of these travelers as best they can, down to their peculiar gaits and fidgety motions. If spotted by a more powerful creature, a paintbrush fox tends to panic and flee, but some have been coaxed into friendship by patient would-be allies.

A paintbrush fox's oil creatures can easily be identified as artificial beings with a brief examination from a sapient creature, but they can still fool wildlife or inattentive onlookers. The oil creatures are always a varied shade of black and gray with a glossy sheen over their skin. With the amount of detail the fox includes, onlookers can even tell if the copy was based on someone they recognize. While the oil creatures aren't capable of speech, adept foxes have picked up on projecting common phrases and noises they've heard to make their copies seem fully capable of speech.

## What Does The Fox Draw?

The paintings that paintbrush foxes draw to mark their territory usually depict what they have recently seen. They may depict landmarks in their territory or interesting creatures that passed through without disturbing the fox. The foxes become excited when they meet other creatures with artistic ability and imitate their work. Some druids have taught paintbrush foxes how to draw elaborate scenes or ritual marks for spells. In other cases, hooligans may teach a paintbrush fox crude drawings or vulgar phrases and delight in the results while maintaining plausible deniability of any vandalism.
