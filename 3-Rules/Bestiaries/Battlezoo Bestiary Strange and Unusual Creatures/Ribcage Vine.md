A ribcage vine is an undead plant creature distorted by foul necrotic energy. A patient predator of living creatures, a ribcage vine feeds on a corpse's vital essence and disguises itself as a partially buried skeleton, waiting for its prey as it feels the vital essence and footsteps approaching. Once it's located its next meal, a ribcage vine suddenly attacks its prey with its grayish, hard leaves, piercing and grabbing its victim as filaments in the leaves pull the vital essence out of the victim's body and send it to a heart-like structure deep within the plant stalk. A ribcage vine can grow anywhere with enough decaying bodies, plants, and necrotic energy, as the energy alters and merges the bodies and plants together.

Although not a simple task, ribcage vines can be cultivated and artificially created for a myriad of purposes, including as a magical component, to protect an area, or even as a conduit of vital essence.

## Spreading Corruption

In extremely favorable conditions, a ribcage vine can grow massive and start to alter nearby flora, assimilating them into its body to form a single gigantic organism. Over time, a truly ancient ribcage vine can corrupt even an entire forest.
