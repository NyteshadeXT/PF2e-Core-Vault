Illiceru are nightmarish creatures that are permanently invisible except for the ends of their two tentacles, which are nearly perfect duplications of humans. They puppet these tentacles as they stalk villages and cities, standing above crowds and climbing on buildings with their spider-like legs. Each of an illiceru's tentacles can speak, and they use this ability to talk to their prey. They convince people to leave town or follow them to alleys, where the illiceru can swallow them without drawing attention.

While an illiceru's tentacles are almost perfect imitations, they can be spotted by a notably trained or particularly paranoid individual. Each illiceru has two tentacles. They often take the appearance of one man and one woman, and they usually act as husband and wife. Their eyes are fake, so they commonly don't make eye contact. When an illiceru is known to be in the area, people tend to be wary of any pair of strangers. In extreme cases, suspicious folk might force strangers to separate and prove they aren't the tentacles of an illiceru.

As an illiceru ages, so too do its puppets. Each puppet ages at a much faster rate than a human, growing from young adulthood to elderly every five years. When its puppets get too old, an illiceru enters a state of hibernation. The puppets fall off during this time, and new, younger puppets take their place. Occasionally, a baby illiceru will emerge from the decay of a discarded puppet and cling to its parent, who feeds it until it grows child-sized puppets of its own.

## Dances With Illiceru

Those who are daring and quick on their feet may test whether two people are illiceru puppets by dancing with them, spinning and weaving until its tentacles get twisted in knots. Of course, plenty of people who aren't puppets are uncomfortable dancing with strangers, and a frustrated illiceru that thinks it is about to be exposed may choose to cut the shenanigans short with its jaws.
