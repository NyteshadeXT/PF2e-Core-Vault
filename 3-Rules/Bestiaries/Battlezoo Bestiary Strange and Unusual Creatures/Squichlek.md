A squichlek is an alien creature formed when the severed tendrils and tentacles of greater aberrations fuse together into a tiny mass of tentacles and gain a life of their own. With a squid-like beak and three slitted eyes spaced equally around its body, squichleks are flying masses of tentacles the size of a cat that vaguely resemble a squid. The writhing of a squichlek's tentacles is particularly sickening to look upon. A squichlek's dark purple-blue coloration and ability to defy gravity reveal their origin from outer space rather than under the sea. While they are capable of surviving the vacuum of space, they aren't inclined to traverse the vast distances alone. Instead, squichleks prefer to travel in the wake of larger void wanderers. They rely on other creatures both as protectors and guides through the great expanse.

Squichleks are attracted to psychic energy and tend to congregate near creatures with powerful mental capabilities. Squichleks defer to creatures that demonstrate impressive mental abilities and won't attack such creatures except as a last resort for survival. When disturbed, they surround and peck at foes with their piercing, penetrative beak while disorienting them with unsettling undulations of tentacles.

Some enterprising wizards, and even a few adventuresome bards, keep squichleks as pets or curiosities. A sharp mental rebuke is usually enough to keep the creatures from attacking their keeper. They are far from docile, however, and eventually try to eat anyone else aside from their keeper who comes near.

## Accidental Summonings

The severed body parts that comprise squichleks are of no more concern to the greater aberrations who shed them than hair or other replaceable parts are to humanoids. However, the psychic sensitivities of squichleks mean that if enough of them gather in one location, a bit of stray conjuration magic can end up summoning the aberrations that make up the squichleks to their location.
