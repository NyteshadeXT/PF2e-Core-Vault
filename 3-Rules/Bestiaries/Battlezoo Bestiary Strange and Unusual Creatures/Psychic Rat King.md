  - name: "Rodent Connection"
    desc: "  When a psychic rat king's spell forces a rodent to make a Will save, the DC is 39, rather than 37. Whenever it attempts a skill check against a rodent, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the roll. These benefits also apply against creatures with rodent features such as ratfolk or wererats. The GM makes the final call as to whether or not a creature is a rodent to determine the effects of the psychic rat king's rodent connection."

While a normal rat king is a group of rats whose tails have been physically intertwined and bound together, a psychic rat king is a group of a dozen or more rats whose minds have been intertwined and bound together in much the same way. Since their interconnection is purely mental, psychic rat kings have no physical connection, and they could be mistaken for an ordinary rat swarm from a distance, at least until the onlooker notices their glowing purple eyes or their enlarged exposed brains.

Hyperintelligent but still possessing the natural instincts of rats, many psychic rat kings can be found in the sewers of large cities, bringing other rats under their control to grow the collective and fulfill some unknown purpose. Many fledgling adventurers have gone down into the sewers expecting an easy time fighting rats, only to be assailed by a swarm with an intelligence and power far exceeding their own.

## To Take Over The World

Psychic rat kings appear to have limitless ambition. Not content with becoming the apex predator of the sewer, they set their sights on overrunning entire cities. This agenda became known due to the unfortunate cautionary tale of one town where a child adopted the psychic rat king, thinking its members were normal rodents. The rats played along as the child dressed them in fancy clothes and cute bonnets, disguising the physical features that would have given their nature away. They played the perfect pet so well that no one suspected them when rats began attacking people in the streets. By the time the family realized they were harboring the masterminds behind the invasion, they were the only ones left. Just them and the thousands of little paws scratching at their door.
