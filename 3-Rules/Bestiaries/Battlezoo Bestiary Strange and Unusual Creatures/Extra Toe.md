    desc: "  When a extra toe hits a humanoid creature larger than itself with its jaws, and that creature has a foot, the extra toe attaches itself to that creature like an additional natural toe, releasing an anesthetic such that the creature doesn't notice the bite or attachment. This is similar to [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grabbing]] the creature, but the extra toe moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The extra toe is flat- footed while attached. If the extra toe is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping the attach or removing the extra toe in other ways doesn't cause bleed damage."

A small, fleshy, caterpillar-like creature, the extra toe is a small insect that has adapted to look like a humanoid toe. When a humanoid walks too close to the nest of an extra toe, the creature attempts to grab their foot with small pincers, injecting a toxin that numbs the flesh. Upon success, the creature then buries its head deep into the humanoid's foot and begins to feed on the blood of its new host.

At a quick glance, the host can easily mistake the extra toe for one of the host's own toes, and the extra toe remains in this position until the host finally notices and removes the parasite, or until it is able to lay its eggs.

If an extra toe is able to lay eggs, they hatch after two weeks, and the larvae squirm their way out of the host's foot and begin their quest to find their own hosts to repeat the process.

The process of bursting forth from the host's foot leaves a small wound on the foot, but just like the fully grown extra toe, the larvae inject the foot with venom to numb the area, and the host might not notice the wound until several hours later. The wound is small and without complications, healing up naturally after a day or two.

In case the host discovers the extra toe and attempts to pluck it off, the extra toe is capable of spraying a scent that burns the eyes, mouth, and nose of the victim. The spray causes the victim to jerk violently from the pain, hopefully losing their grip on the extra toe and giving the parasite the opportunity to escape. If attacked, an extra toe makes haste for the nearest undergrowth and tries to hide out of sight.

## Doctors Hate This One Trick

Some humanoids voluntarily host one or more extra toes, accepting the parasite's disgusting lifecycle as an acceptable trade-off for its benefits. One detail its detractors fail to mention is that the extra toe senses when toenails on its host's real toes grow too long. It detaches while the host is sleeping and trims the nails back with its teeth, forestalling any maintenance that could draw attention to its presence. Another advantage is for those who may be missing a toe at birth or due to an accident. A complete set of toes is important for balance and agility, and an extra toe is a cheap and easy replacement!
