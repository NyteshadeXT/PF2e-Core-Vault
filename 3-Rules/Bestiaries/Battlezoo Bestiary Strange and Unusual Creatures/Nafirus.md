    desc: "  A nafirus's swarm is part of its true self. After defeating a nafirus, its swarm disperses, and 2d4 days later, one of the constituent creatures grows into a new nafirus if even a single one escapes. While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the nafirus's foes have to dispatch the [[undefined]] creatures before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the nafirus collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 Flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the creatures escapes, and the nafirus is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the nafirus."

```



High mountain peaks are generally deserted, desolate places, and that's just how a nafirus likes it. Nafiruses view the presence of almost any living creature, particularly landbound creatures and even more especially humanoids, as a desecration of these pristine places' stark beauty. As such, they rapidly and violently attack any interlopers in their domain.

Unlike other iruses, nafiruses care little for subtlety. Instead, they dive down on their victims in cacophonous, multicolored fury. In combat, they zealously use their mobility, snatching climbing opponents off of walls to plummet to their doom and driving flying creatures to the ground.

A nafirus has a body like a large gliding bird, such as a condor or eagle, with plain brown plumage. However, just above its wings, instead of an avian head, a humanoid torso and head grow, complete with arms, hands, and an additional set of feathered wings.

A nafirus is attended by a mass of songbirds, each no larger than a human hand. While these birds all have the same shape and structure, they have wildly varying colorations and patterns. The songbird swarm has an impressive range of notes and can make beautiful songs, but they are also capable of painfully discordant tones.

* * *

Iruses are a family of fey creatures who find beauty in remote places most humanoids and other mortal folk overlook. Unfortunately for those who pass through their domains, they assume anyone in their territory is there to despoil it and react violently.

Each irus is made up of a main body and a swarm of smaller bodies, each with a different physical shape. Both body and swarm are a single creature, however, and an irus can control the smaller bodies as easily as an arm or leg. Should the main body be destroyed, one of the smaller creatures will slowly grow into a new main body.

There is some evidence that all iruses are actually the same species adapted to different environments. For example, a swarm body from one type of irus can cleave off and form a new main body of a different type if it encounters the correct environment.

## Nafirus Symphonies

Nafiruses might be evil, but they love music, and they often compose complex, haunting symphonies to be performed by their own songbirds. While nafiruses are ordinarily the most territorial of iruses, there are tales of accomplished bards managing to encroach on a nafirus's mountain respectfully and survive the encounter by sharing their own musical compositions with the nafirus.

## Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey And Analysis Of The Field

The metaphysical process of swarm rejuvenation is complicated, and among the scholars who sought to understand it, many died to irus attacks before one extremely persistent researcher managed to publish a treatise named Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey and Analysis of the Field, which is currently recognized as the most prominent collection of theories and data on the subject.

According to the text, when an irus's central body is defeated, it spreads the primal energy of its fey self throughout the swarm of creatures that make up its extended body. Each of these creatures is connected to the others and the main body by an invisible web of magical links, similar to arteries or a ley line network, and the web persists after the body's death.

This means that no matter how many of the swarm's constituents are killed, the irus can quickly shift their energy into whichever manages to survive. However, the transfer isn't lossless, and an unpredictable amount of the essence spills out during the process, especially if many of the swarm's constituent creatures also perish. This leads to a significant variation in how long it takes for the irus to rejuvenate, as the more energy it loses, the longer it takes to return.
