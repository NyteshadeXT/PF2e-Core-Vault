    desc: " (aura,fire) 30 feet. The furnace newt naturally exudes an aura that empowers fire within its radius. Creatures within 30 feet of a furnace newt gain a +1 status bonus to damage rolls whenever they deal fire damage. This status bonus increases depending on the furnace newt's increasing size from All-Consuming Fire, to +2 if the newt is Medium, +3 if the newt is Large, and +4 if the newt is Huge."

  - name: "All-Consuming Fire"
    desc: " (fire,polymorph,primal) Whenever a creature other than a furnace newt uses a spell or ability with the fire trait within 30 feet of the furnace newt, the furnace newt feeds on the thermal energy of the fire, growing in size to the next size category (from Small to Medium, from Medium to Large, or from Large to Huge). This ability can take effect multiple times, though at most once per round. If the newt is already Huge when this ability is activated, it must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude check save or explode, killing it and dealing 4d4 fire damage to all creatures in a 15-foot emanation (DC 19 Reflex check save). On a successful save, the newt doesn't absorb the heat and remains Huge. Whenever a creature uses a cold spell or ability within 30 feet of the furnace newt, it instead shrinks one size category, to a minimum of Small. If the newt was already Small, it is instead [[undefined]] until the end of its next turn. Like the growth, this can take effect multiple times, but only once per round.\n\n[[Effects/Effect_ All-Consuming Fire|Effect: All-Consuming Fire]]"

Curious and playful, cat-sized furnace newts are nevertheless quite dangerous. Should a creature intrude upon their territory, furnace newts fight fiercely to defend their homes, but furnace newts' true power lies in their unique physiology. Furnace newts live in hot, volcanic regions and are well adapted to high temperatures. As a furnace newt is exposed to more and more heat, it siphons some of the thermal energy to empower itself, growing larger and, in turn, radiating heat and fire around itself. This makes furnace newts popular additions to the domains of creatures that make use of fire, as the newt can add significant firepower to their side in a prolonged fight.

Most furnace newts have a strong enough preservation instinct to vent heat until they maintain a small size, but sometimes, in the heat of battle, a furnace newt won't have the time or inclination to shed excess energy. Many cautionary tales exist of cabals of young wizards capturing a furnace newt to defend their tower but then accidentally detonating it by using too many fire spells in its vicinity.

Despite the danger they present, however, furnace newts also enjoy popularity as companions, especially among blacksmiths who can provide regular access to a comfortably hot environment.

## A Spicy Addition

Recently, the furnace newt has taken the culinary world by storm as enterprising chefs discovered that having one live in their smoker adds a distinct pungency to its output. Some restaurants take the concept a step further and serve finger food directly atop of furnace newts. The newts are quite content with this arrangement, so long as they get a share of the food while basking in the attention. Connoisseurs describe the resulting flavor as earthy, rustic, and toasty, while less- distinguished diners complain the smoked meats taste "bog standard" and "like a cow drowned in a swamp of peppers."
