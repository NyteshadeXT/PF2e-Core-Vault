Cryptfowl are pale, vicious chickens that feed on maggots and other insects that feed on corpses. Despite being deadly monsters when encountered in their usual swarms, townsfolk who live near their hunting grounds don't treat them with as much vitriol as a stranger might expect. This is because they tend to roost where graves and corpses are common, feeding mostly on the unwanted pests that infest such places. Since they can be distracted and placated easily with an offering of a meal of maggots, it's not difficult for crypt keepers to find the time they need to dig fresh graves and inter the newly deceased without stirring the swarm's ire.

Cryptfowl make for surprisingly good opponents against ghouls, zombies, and other weak undead who try to eat them, due to their bodies having adapted to shake off diseases common to these creatures. Cryptfowl rely on their spittle to keep them safe from ingested diseases, but that doesn't mean their beaks are sanitary. Any reckless living visitors who disturb their roost risk being afflicted with acidic saliva.

Unfortunately for the living, crypt fowl can sometimes become carriers of dangerous diseases, and in those cases, settlements need to find adventurers to exterminate the creatures before the infection spreads.

## Tastes Like Chicken

The truly daring, or foolhardy (or both), go out of their way to find cryptfowl as it is said that because of their unusual diet, their meat has a truly unique taste and texture. However, if not properly prepared, there have been reports of strange and unusual side effects after consuming their meat. Some side effects are mild, such as temporary blindness or loss of smell, but some unlucky diners have become horribly diseased, or even perished. Still, consuming a cryptfowl is considered a rare delicacy, and there are always those who are willing to literally risk their lives for a new and unique experience.
