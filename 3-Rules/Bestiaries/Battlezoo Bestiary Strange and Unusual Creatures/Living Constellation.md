While the light of a star is often seen as a sign of hope, living constellations represent the exact opposite. Otherworldly and enigmatic, they live among the normal stars of the night sky. Their bodies are made up of sickly green stars with lines joining them like joints. They orbit the world erratically with unpredictable positioning, descending and taking on the forms of well-known constellations to garner the attention of those who look to the stars in the night.

When mortals see them, living constellations attempt to lead those mortals into perilous situations in order to feed off of their fear. This effect becomes strongest in close proximity, and so living constellations leave their homes in outer space to feast on fear. Scholarly attempts to study living constellations have thus far resulted in failure, leaving the researchers befuddled or trembling with fear for weeks on end. The malignant aberrations welcome this, however, as more attention grants them a greater audience to manipulate for their fear.

## Unspeakable Horror

Speculation abounds that living constellations are agents of the Great Old Ones sent to determine if a world is ripe for conquest. While the occasional living constellation may not be cause for great alarm, multitudes appearing in rapid succession can stir thoughts of the apocalypse in even the most composed individuals. True or not, these beliefs serve the living constellation's purpose by arousing more fear for it to consume.
