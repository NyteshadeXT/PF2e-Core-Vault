    desc: "  A stiltwalker's long dexterous limbs provide it most of its defense and its main body is usually 30 feet in the air on its stilt-like legs, which means that being tripped is even more painful for a stiltwalker than other creatures. A tripped stiltwalker takes 15 bludgeoning damage as its body slams into the ground. While [[undefined]] from being [[undefined]], a stiltwalker takes a –4 circumstance penalty to AC instead of the usual –2 circumstance penalty, as its easy for its foes to attack its body directly."

The creature must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude check save, with the following effects. The stiltwalker's multiple attack penalty applies to Trebuchet Toss's DC, even though Trebuchet Toss doesn't have an attack roll.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature not only isn't thrown, they also struggle free of the grapple and are no longer grabbed.\n\n**Success** The creature isn't thrown.\n\n**Failure** The stiltwalker throws the creature up to 50 feet up into the air, and can also throw the creature up to 50 feet laterally. Falling from this throw typically causes the creature to take 25 bludgeoning damage from falling and fall [[undefined]]."

Stiltwalkers are incredibly long-limbed monstrosities twisted from giants. While they're only encountered rarely, when a stiltwalker appears, it is the stuff of nightmares, able to decimate a village or small town's entire guard contingent on its own. Its body has a twisted and warped but almost humanoid anatomy, with extreme proportions even compared to giants.

Each limb stretches 40 feet in length and ends in a single, vast hand. Its torso, however, is a small, bulbous core balanced off these limbs. A stiltwalker roams by moving on all fours and using its extreme reach to climb nimbly, tending to roost in areas of great verticality, such as along cliff faces, within vast redwood forests, or in immense caverns deep underground.

When hunting, a stiltwalker seeks out opportunities to drag, drop, or toss prey to their doom and let gravity do the work that their strength can't accomplish. Once they notice nearby prey, they perch themselves at the apex of the area, using their height to monitor for the slightest hint of movement before diving in with their limbs when prey arrives within reach of an ambush.

Stiltwalkers tend to be solitary creatures, but on the rare occasion that more than one stiltwalker attacks at a time, tales are told of dozens of awful limbs crisscrossing the sky and entire towns being methodically dragged out of their hiding holes one by one, tossed into the air, and dashed on the ground in bloody pulp.

## What Lies Beneath

What creates stiltwalkers is a mystery. Common folk assume aberrations from space hang giants from the sky until their limbs stretch and their minds break, but those in the know whisper of hands from underground. Perhaps when stiltwalkers throw their victims skyward, they are trying to save others from their creators.
