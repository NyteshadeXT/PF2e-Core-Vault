The result of decades of long research headed by a group of disreputable wizards and experimental alchemists, carnivorous chapeaus serve many purposes for their unsavory creators. While they are often employed as an unexpected vector or tool for assassination, they also function as torture devices or even traps for greedy and unwary intruders who can't resist the allure of an extremely fashionable piece of headwear.

The construction and form of carnivorous chapeaus are not limited to a stereotypical hat made entirely of cloth material. In truth, a carnivorous chapeau is capable of appearing like any kind of headgear, assuming its creator chooses to construct it in that manner. The possibilities for carnivorous chapeaus are endless, including forms as varied and disparate as a leather cap, an iron helmet, or even a golden crown. Carnivorous chapeaus are able to follow simple commands such as "attack when there is only a single creature you can sense" or "attack when you hear this word," though more complex instructions can wind up being too complicated for a carnivorous chapeau to understand, leading to imperfect performance or even drastically unwanted behavior. Few assassins appreciate it when their creation kills the wrong target.

Although potentially lethal in the right situation, the use of carnivorous chapeaus faded somewhat among shadowy organizations and disgruntled nobility due to its limited ability to pursue once a victim escapes. Although rumors insist that carnivorous chapeaus are merely prototypes for a more dangerous construct, their most common and traditional use is to affix them to an interrogated creature as a simple means of causing pain and injury.

## Hang On To Your Hat

Recent attempts to rebrand carnivorous chapeaus as "hats no gust of wind can take" have experienced surprising success when combined with iron skull caps.
