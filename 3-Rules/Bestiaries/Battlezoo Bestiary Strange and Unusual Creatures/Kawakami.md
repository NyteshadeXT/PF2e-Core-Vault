    desc: "  Every kami is bound to a ward: a specific animal, plant, object, or location. A kami can merge with or emerge from their ward as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While merged, the kami can observe their surroundings with their usual senses as well as the senses of their ward, but can't move, communicate with, or control their ward. Additionally, a kami merged with their ward recovers Hit Points each minute as if they spent an entire day resting. A kawakami's ward is a river, and they can observe anything within the river while merged."

Appearing as an incorporeal humanoid made from flowing water that turns silty when angered, kawakami are protector spirits. They are a rare hybrid of kami and primal spirits that came about to resolve a dispute over which group would protect river systems. These hybrid creatures are highly protective of a specific river, their ward, and have a mercurial temperament that changes between embracing the destructive power of their river's flooding and the restorative gift of their river's bounty. Although not hostile to those who respect their river, a kawakami is willing to take extreme action to protect their ward. If they fail to do so, often due to excessive pollution from nearby societies, they can become stuck in one of their two states, causing damage to those relying on the river or the nearby ecosystem.

## Water Always Wins

Societies that respect a river can work with its guardian for the benefit of all. Kawakami are happy to advise farmers where floods are likely to occur so that they don't build permanent structures in those areas. In exchange, those areas become fertile land for a bountiful yield of crops when the waters recede, and the river remains healthy by purging itself of silt buildup.
