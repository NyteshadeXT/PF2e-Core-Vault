Ictioctors are insectoid qlippoth with a hivemind consciousness. An ictioctor has no face to speak of. Instead, its chitinous thorax is topped with a teeming swarm of jellyfish. This swarm is not merely an adornment but the seat of the creature's schismatic consciousness. Ictioctors are fascinated by creatures with a solitary mind, and the qlippoth might attempt to study such specimens or add their unique minds to their own assembly. Of course, either of these activities usually begins by splitting open the creature's skull. Ictioctors sometimes parlay with brain collectors to obtain specimens in exchange for showing the aliens passageways through their abyssal realms.

Ictioctor minds are prone to turning on themselves due to the lack of a central authority to coordinate the swarm. Members may decide to pursue different goals, leading to the main body engaging in strange behaviors such as walking in circles or even clawing itself. Such schisms are more likely when the ictioctor has recently integrated a new creature's knowledge. The information may reach some parts of the swarm sooner than others or cause them to react in different ways.

## Different Mind-sets

Other variants of ictioctors have been observed, with different types of swarms: ticks, amoebas, rats, or any other creature with a swarm mind. You can represent these differences by changing the type of damage dealt by Swarming Bites (such as piercing for a rat swarm) and the affliction to which the target is exposed (such as filth fever for a rat swarm) instead of jellyfish venom. Some variations based on flying swarms might grant the ictioctor a fly Speed instead of a swim Speed.
