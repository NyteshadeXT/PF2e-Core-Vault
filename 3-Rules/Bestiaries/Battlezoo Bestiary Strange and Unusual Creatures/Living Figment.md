    desc: " (mental) As insubstantial beings, living figments are unable to affect the physical world on their own, and their attacks rely on their target's inadvertent cooperation, through their belief in the illusion, to cause harm. A living figment is incapable of directly harming a creature while they are undetected."

    desc: "  A living figment's attacks deal damage because the target believes they are real. The first time each round a creature is hit by a living figment's Strike, they can attempt a DC 25 Will check save to disbelieve the illusory attack. On a failure, they take damage as normal. On a success, the creature disbelieves the illusion, causing the living figment's subsequent illusory weapon Strikes to gain the nonlethal trait against that creature and deal half damage to that creature."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,illusion,olfactory,visual) A living figment is unbound to any form; they can appear as anything that can fit inside a 10 foot by 10 foot square. A living figment that isn't adjacent to a hostile creature can choose to perfectly mimic the terrain in which it finds itself, allowing it to hide even while it's directly observed. The living figment makes a Stealth check as part of using Fanciful Forms, becoming [[undefined]] on a success. In addition, it can choose to conceal traps or other hazards in the area by changing into a form that obscures them or covers them up, using the figment's Stealth or Stealth DC instead of the hazard's, if it is higher."

  - name: "Sensory Overload"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (illusion,mental,occult) The living figment takes the form of a bewildering cacophony of nonsensical sounds, sights, and even smells to disorient its enemies. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude check save. This ability can only affect creatures with precise auditory, olfactory, or visual senses, but not living figments.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[undefined]] for 1 round. It can spend an Interact action to end the effect.\n\n**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 1 minute. It can spend an Interact action to reduce the duration by 1d4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[undefined]] for 1 minute. It can spend one Interact action to reduce the effect to dazzled."

Also known as "living illusions," living figments occasionally arise from highly complex, long-lasting illusions that eventually take on a mind of their own. The attitudes and interests of living figments vary as widely as their appearances, but their personalities tend to reflect their original purposes. Illusions intended to entertain produce more whimsical and gregarious living figments, while more secretive and hostile living figments arise from spells intended to conceal traps or bewilder foes.

Though rare, living figments are sociable creatures, and they eagerly cooperate among themselves to create larger and grander illusions than they would be capable of creating alone. Once independent of their creators, living figments are less trusting of physical beings, but they sometimes lend their talents to those who can win their confidence.

## Mind Your Own Business

Merchants have discovered that living figments are effective at encouraging people to buy their wares. Some create charismatic figures who model what they are selling, while others prefer energetic creatures who annoy people until they make a purchase. There really is no better way of getting inside a customer's head.
