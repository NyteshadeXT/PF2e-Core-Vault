    desc: " (illusion,primal,visual) When a lorekith tells a story, they are surrounded by images representing the tale's events. These are obviously illusory to most creatures, though animals and small children might need to make a Perception check against the lorekith's spell DC to recognize it, at the GM's discretion."

  - name: "Myth Masks"
    desc: "  A typical lorekith carries three masks that they modify as needed; the hero, the mentor, and the villain. They can swap masks with an Interact action, and they gain benefits based on which mask they currently wear. Their masks have a Hardness of 3 and 12 Hit Points, with a Broken Threshold of 6, and a creature can target a lorekith's mask using the lorekith's AC and saves, though the masks aren't normally affected by area effects while in the lorekith's possession. If their mask is broken, a lorekith loses access to that mask's benefits until they Craft a new one, which costs them no valuable materials and takes only 1 day. Rarer lorekith might have access to more masks than these basic three.\n\n*   **Hero** The lorekith gains fast healing 2.\n*   **Mentor** The lorekith gains a +1 status bonus to skill checks.\n*   **Villain** The lorekith gains a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\n[[Effects/Effect_ Myth Mask|Effect: Myth Mask]]\n\n### Additional Lorekith Masks\n\nWhile nearly every lorekith has worn a mask for the essential roles of a story, some have more specific tastes, creating masks such as the conflagration, the dragon, or the fool.\n\n*   **The Conflagration** The lorekith gains resistance 5 to fire, and its shadow puppet Strike's damage changes to fire.\n*   **The Dragon** The lorekith's Intimidation bonus becomes +13.\n*   **The Fool** The lorekith gains a +2 status bonus to saves against mental effects."

While the wily fey have developed a variety of techniques to turn any conversation into a story, activities that depend on the lorekith speaking that would normally take at least 1 minute take twice as long, and they might be hard to interpret when phrased as a story."

Lorekith are fey creatures obsessed with myths and folklore, traveling the land collecting variations on their favorite stories, their own personal epics, and retelling them to the delight of others. Short, slight creatures, lorekith look like wooden puppets with long sleeves and several painted masks, bearing the likenesses of monsters and heroes.

Though they may delight in stories of great battles, lorekith prefer to avoid combat whenever possible, using their illusion magic to escape or deescalate a confrontation when negotiation fails. When fighting alongside more powerful figures, however, lorekith are quick to inspire them to new heights, eager to record their deeds to retell later.
