    desc: "`pf2:3` (mental,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The chosaintor forms a protective bond with a vulnerable child it can see within 60 feet; if the chosaintor attempts to use this ability and the target isn't a valid vulnerable child (GM's discretion), the chosaintor can use the ability again on the same day, ignoring the usual frequency limitations. While the bond exists, the chosaintor can communicate telepathically with their bonded companion with a range of 300 feet. The chosaintor can only have one bonded companion at a time, so using Bond Companion again ends the previous bond. The bond is also broken when the chosaintor's companion becomes an adult (this age varies based on culture and individual maturity, and is determined by the GM). Finally, the bond also ends if the chosaintor or the bonded companion dies."

  - 1: Chosaintor
```



Chosaintors appear to children who are vulnerable or living in unsafe situations. The creatures use their wide-eyed, innocent appearance to aid them in befriending the child, resorting to their charm spells only if needed. Once they bond with a child, they are able to use their abilities to telepathically speak with the child, deepening the bond between them into one of friendship. To those other than the bonded child, the chosaintor appears as a wide-eyed kitten who never grows, speaking only in mews and meows.

Chosaintors use the children's stories of monsters under the bed as cover to protect their identities. All stories are rooted in fact, after all. That the chosaintors are exactly opposite of the tales told of them amuses them greatly.

At night, a chosaintor curls up under the foot of their bonded child's bed as the child sleeps, keeping a watchful eye on the sleeping child throughout the night. If they see someone threatening their companion, their appearance changes to something far fiercer. Doubling in height, they typically attempt to scare off the would-be attacker. If the attacker persists, the chosaintor then launches an attack, brutally baring their teeth and claws as they tear into the threat. When a chosaintor has finished the job, they leave no evidence of the threat or their own protective actions for the child to find in the morning.

## Felicitous Legacies

The magical bond between chosaintor and child may break upon adulthood, but the emotional bond remains. Chosaintors prefer creating new bonds close to their former wards and may call upon those who figured out their true nature if they need aid. Some embattled communities even worship the fey as their protectors, but most simply pay forward the kindness by caring for other children or animals. Cats are popular pets for those who grow up with chosaintors, though they are in for a fright the first time they learn that real ones vomit hairballs.
