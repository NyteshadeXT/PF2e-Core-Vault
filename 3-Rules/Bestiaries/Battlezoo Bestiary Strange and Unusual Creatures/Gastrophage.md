Throughout the land, trolls are a menace to small towns and villages. Aside from fire and the occasional flask of acid, trolls have little to fear... aside from a gastrophage, that is. Gastrophages are the natural predators of trolls; however, they are by no means a welcome sight, as gastrophages are happy to supplement their diet with livestock and townsfolk. The stomach bile of a gastrophage is highly corrosive, and these beasts have many pores along their skin from which they can spray this foul substance. When a gastrophage encounters a troll, it rushes towards its prey and sprays corrosive bile at the unfortunate troll. The beast then sinks its teeth into the troll as the bile begins to predigest the victim.

The bile is far too corrosive for even a troll's legendary regeneration to repair, and the troll is soon torn apart limb from limb. Like trolls, gastrophages have powerful regenerative abilities and are able to heal nearly any wound. However, unlike a troll, they can heal severe wounds caused by flame and corrosive acid. Only freezing temperatures are capable of slowing a gastrophage's metabolism enough to halt its regeneration.

When prey is plentiful and close at hand, gastrophages are known to spray bile from all of their pores at once, covering all within their vicinity in corrosive bile, including themselves. This makes for a horrific sight as the beast dissolves and reforms unhindered as it assails its prey. These acidic beasts have no innate resistance to their own bile and instead rely on their rapid regeneration to counteract their own stomach acid. A gastrophage coated in bile is even more dangerous, as those attacking the beast risk exposing themselves to the bile.

Gastrophages have voracious appetites due to the high metabolism required by their regenerative flesh. However, they prefer easy prey and are quick to give up when chasing elusive targets.

## The Land Is Healing?

Some believe that gastrophages are nature's response to trolls, whose populations ravage the land if left unchecked. It's an odd perspective to take given that gastrophage rampages can be more destructive than the problem they purportedly solve. The kernel of truth behind the belief comes from the phenomenon of gastrophages emerging out of the earth en masse. This behavior is due to their weakness to cold, however. During winters, gastrophages retreat underground. Those who find deep cavern networks remain active, while those in shallow burrows instead hibernate, suppressing their acid generation.
