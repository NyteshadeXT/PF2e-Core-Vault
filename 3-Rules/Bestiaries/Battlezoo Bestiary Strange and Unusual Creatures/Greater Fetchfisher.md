When using the [[undefined]] action, they can take cover behind Large or larger objects, reducing their space down from 15 by 15 feet to as small as 5 by 5 feet as necessary."

  - name: "Snatch and Dive"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The greater fetchfisher stretches their arm and snatches away their prey before diving into the shadows. The greater fetchfisher makes a claw Strike against a creature within 15 feet, despite the claw normally having a reach of 10 feet. If the greater fetchfisher hits and uses Improved Grab, they move the creature to the nearest square adjacent to the greater fetchfisher. The greater fetchfisher can then Shadow Step. If it chooses to Shadow Step, the [[undefined]] creature must attempt a DC 30 Will check save. On a failure, the target teleports with the greater fetchfisher, arriving in the same relative position and remaining grabbed. On a success, the greater fetchfisher can choose not to teleport if it wants to keep the creature grabbed."

While the majority of fetchfishers seem content to subsist off of small-scale banditry, there are rare individuals with more terrible aspirations. Fetchfishers can develop a taste for evil magic and negative energy, as they naturally produce a small amount of primal shadow magic. A fetchfisher who regularly consumes such power eventually undergoes a transformation into a greater fetchfisher.

Few understand fetchfisher metamorphosis, as it is a blessedly rare occurrence. At some point, after consuming enough magical energy, the fetchfisher enters their den and hibernates, usually guarded by generations of their own offspring. After a few months, the greater fetchfisher emerges, monstrously transformed. Greater fetchfishers are heavily muscled, with a larger, fish-hooked killing claw on the index digit of each forepaw. Their jawbones extend beyond the snout in a grotesque, fleshy, crocodilian maw, lined with multiple rows of teeth. While the beast's eyes aren't as thoroughly transformed, their positioning shifts higher on the skull for a broader field of view. Those unlucky enough to encounter a greater fetchfisher swear they exhibit a higher predatory intellect than their kin.

An area that has been routinely hunted by a greater fetchfisher has several telltale signs. Ambient light seems bleary. Shadows might extend further than they should and diminish light more completely. Shadowy places, like woods and gullies, might develop the stench of rancid cooking fat. These are side effects of frequent travel by greater fetchfishers, as their slime residue settles into the nooks where shadows fall.

Fetchfishers are a family of mammalian beasts from the Shadow Plane that hunt on the borders between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. Exposure to shadowy energies can cause them to grow larger and more powerful.

## Fetchfisher Education

Fetchfishers are able to defend themselves and hunt in a brood even at a young age. However, at this point, their mind hasn't yet fully developed, and they act more like animals than their adult counterparts. Thus, responsible adult fetchfishers watch over a brood swarm. Adult fetchfishers use harsh but fair practical hands-on lessons to teach important topics like hunting, language, nearby threats, and geography.

## Fetchfisher Collaborators

On the rarer occasions that fetchfishers hunt on the Material Plane, they have been known to cooperate with mimics to launch elaborate ambush schemes. In these schemes, the mimic acts as bait, adhering the victim in place to allow the fetchfisher to either gang up on a solitary victim or to snatch and drag away a back-line ally to make the mimic's job easier.

## Greater Fetchfisher Rivals

Many of the more sadistic schemers who occupy a similar niche to fetchfishers, such as bogeymen and bugbears, tend to think of themselves as the apex predators of the dark. A greater fetchfisher might observe these half-clever haunters for months from the darker places between shadows. While a bogeyman savors the process of terrorizing and baiting victims until they are encircled within their trap, a greater fetchfisher waits and bides their time. Only once their allies are in place and their mark has conveniently gathered victims for the kill do they strike. Then, like a leviathan appearing before a shoal in the gloom, the greater fetchfisher gorges itself on predator and prey alike.
