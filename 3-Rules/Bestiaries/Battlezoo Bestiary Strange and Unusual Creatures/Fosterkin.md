Fosterkin are benevolent aberrations who love and care for young creatures without parents. According to popular folklore, fosterkin were created when an orphan made a powerful wish upon a star to have loving parents, and that wish was granted by strange benevolent entities beyond the stars. The child's fur coat, or perhaps their rug, came to life and transformed into the first fosterkin, a creature filled with parental love for the child who innately knew how to provide adequate care and protection. The child's wish surged in their heart, growing and changing into a wish to share this strange form of parental love with all the world's children. Thus, hundreds of rugs or coats nearby transformed into a flock of fosterkin, who would each seek out children of their own to foster.

The validity of this origin story is debatable, but it's certainly true that fosterkin are unable to procreate. Despite this, fosterkin have a primal urge to protect and raise children. These friendly creatures hide throughout various civilizations, searching for children in need of parents. Skittish by nature around adult humanoids, fosterkin move discreetly through cities and towns by disguising themselves as fur coats and rugs, a ruse that comes naturally to these furry creatures.

Fosterkin can't bear to see children suffer, and they feel the worst thing in the world is when terrible parents don't love or care for their children. Thus, they seek out abusive households and wait for opportune moments to steal children away from their terrible parents. When a favorable moment occurs, the fosterkin makes its presence known to the abused child, innately knowing how to soothe the youth. If the child agrees, the fosterkin then sneaks away with its newly adopted ward.

If confronted, a fosterkin prefers to use nonviolent means to escape its adversary, however it will give its life if necessary to protect its ward. Once a foe is rendered incapacitated, the fosterkin attempts to modify the foe's memory so that it forgets the encounter with the fosterkin.

With the child's consent, the fosterkin can use this same power to erase childhood trauma from its adopted offspring. Fosterkin raise children as if they were their own, and few things can match the love and support a fosterkin parent provides.

Rumor has it that a ritual exists to draw the stars' attention and create new fosterkin. However, if such a ritual exists, it has long been hidden.

## A World Apart

Fosterkin are often uncomfortable in crowded cities and instead prefer raising their children in a rural setting. Some lead nomadic lifestyles, training their wards to be adventurers and survivalists. Others build treehouse villages or networks of underground burrows to emulate the societies their children came from. Dozens of fosterkin and children may make up these communities, with grown children that the fosterkin previously raised acting as intermediaries between them and those in an industrial society.
