Bog bombers are huge creatures that resemble red bullfrogs with draconic features. They are a hybrid species, a cross between a flame drake and a giant frog. Boggards found a way to breed these monsters together, which either results in a nest of bog bombers or dozens of dead boggards.

Boggards use bog bombers to defend and expand their territory. They lure these monsters with juicy giant dragon flies. However, there are times when these delicious meals go unnoticed and a bog bomber escapes, looking for bigger prey. That is why it's possible to see feral bog bombers in the wild.

The reason boggards go to such great lengths to produce bog bombers is that they make formidable allies, especially in battle. Bog bombers have the ability to spit huge balls of fire at their prey. In addition, they can jump and sprint incredible distances, and they have the ability to breathe both fire and water.

Bog bombers tend to consume their prey by lashing out with their sticky, fiery tongues, pulling their prey toward their gaping giant maws. Once within the gullet, the bog bomber spits their prey out in a fireball and then consumes the exploded remains.

If boggards continue to breed such monstrosities, they might start to conquer lands outside their home swamps, with bog bombers leading the charge.

## Fatal Attraction

Bog bombers are instinctively attracted to other fiery creatures. Boggards must be careful to keep them away from fire elementals lest they abandon their masters for shinier, fierier ones, and villages near boggard territories maintain straw effigies they can ignite to distract them. Red dragons are the ultimate attraction for these pyromaniacs, but sadly, the dragons do not return their affection. A red dragon may tolerate the presence of bog bombers for a little while if it is planning to attack a city, at which time it picks them up to drop from the sky.
