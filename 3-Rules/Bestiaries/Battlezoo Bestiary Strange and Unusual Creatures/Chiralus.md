A common refrain in folklore throughout the world paints some evil creatures (such as vampires) as so horrible, or perhaps so alien, that they are utterly unable to cast a reflection, despite being normally visible. These tales often turn out to be true, but leave a lingering question of, "Why?" But perhaps the question should instead be, "Where?" As any magical scholar or seasoned adventurer will attest, mirrors and the reflections seen in them often hold strange and mercurial power. For those who seemingly defy such reflection, their visage may not be cast back at them but instead cast away, drifting through the Astral Plane. These distorted figures—tiny fragments of pure malevolence—eventually coalesce into a chiralus.

Just like a reflection on a mirror's surface, chiralus are two-dimensional, appearing impossibly flat and almost indistinguishable from a mundane mirror, aside from the fact that living creatures don't see their reflections within, instead seeing the reflections of creatures who otherwise don't have them, like vampires. Observed side-on, a chiralus is almost imperceptible—a property they often use to their deadly advantage, as they are driven by little else besides a primordial desire to cut, sever, and kill.

Mirrorborn are a family of creatures with connections to both the Astral Plane and the infinite alternate realities beyond the twisted dimensions found within mirrors. Much like the evil duplicates found on the other side of a _[[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Darkside Mirror|Darkside Mirror]]_, most mirrorborn represent the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, of things that aren't but could have been. This category of mirrorborn includes tahagatas and fragmentors, two entities formed from the paradoxical distortion of potential into a corporeal form. To a lesser extent, the same is true of chiraluses, the incarnations of the reflections that could never be, embodying reflections of creatures like vampires that ordinarily have no reflections. Finally, odrazu are highly unusual mirrorborn, as they form from a symbiotic hybrid between a devil and the Astral Plane, peppered with otherworldly energies from alternate mirror dimensions.

One commonality among all mirrorborn is their physical connection to mirrors: odrazu feed on reflections, chiraluses appear as two-dimensional reflections, tahagatas take a form built of myriad mirrored surfaces, and fragmentors are composed of countless jagged mirror shards. This doesn't mean that they are necessarily more likely to be found in areas where mirrors are more common, as each of the creatures brings their mirrored physicality along with them.

Despite being a family of creatures, mirrorborn rarely interact with each other. Even fragmentors, which can sometimes form out of a destroyed tahagata, rarely converse with tahagatas, and tahagatas for their part find the fragmented potential inherent to a fragmentor's essence distasteful and jarring, much like the sensation of wrongness they feel from an original creature after the tahagata juxtaposes with it.

## Untethered

Travelers to the Astral Plane must be especially wary of chiralus, since the creatures' infinitely sharp form can sever even an astral tether, tragically ending their journey.

## Through The Looking Glass

In addition to _darkside mirrors_, which send forth alternative versions of those reflected within, it's possible, though rare, to connect to realms beyond an ordinary mirror and encounter mirrorborn. The phenomenon is far more likely in places brimming with astral energies or in locations where the veil between the mortal world and the world beyond the mirror has been torn before, becoming thinner and thinner in the process. Those who enter through a mirror find that these mirror realms operate on their own bizarre rules, and while they eventually might re-emerge from another mirror, they often do so changed.

## Other Mirrorborn

The mirrorborn presented here are just the tip of the iceberg, as the possibilities in the infinite mirror universes are just as endless as the multiverse itself. Some rumors of other mirrorborn include:

*   **Darksiders**, creatures originating from a darkside mirror who have become permanent residents of this world, either seeking to bring more residents from their reality or to establish their own fiefdom in this one.
*   **Kryshards**, malevolent entities that form from the reflective shards of shattered crystal balls and use mirrors to spy on many other creatures and use the information for their own foul purposes.
*   **Mirror Mimes**, creatures who hide within mirrors and replace a creature's natural reflection in order to devour that creature's psyche, attempting to stay unnoticed by mimicking the creature's actions in front of mirrors.
*   **Reflectors**, creatures that position many mirrors across the battlefield when stalking their prey, shooting beams of light that bounce off the mirrors at unexpected angles and irradiate their victims.
