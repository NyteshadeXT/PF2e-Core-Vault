Imaginary friends are fiercely protective manifestations of daydreams. Anomalies that cause tears between the Dreamlands and reality can cause an imaginary friend to manifest from the thoughts, memories, and unwavering belief of those who first imagined them. They often appear as the ideal form of their creator and are usually of the same age and heritage, though some imaginary friends appear as animals, constructs, dinosaurs, or mythical creatures.

Imaginary friends are brave and daring, and their willingness to sacrifice their own existence to protect their comrade is unparalleled. Imaginary friends aren't naturally aggressive, though; they're amicable companions whose selflessness goes a long way toward explaining their readiness to lay down their life for a companion.

## Other Imaginary Friends

Medium imaginary friends are common, and they gain no benefits or penalties because of their larger size. Large creatures usually have Large imaginary friends, in which case you might choose to also apply the elite adjustments described in Pathfinder Bestiary. Flying and aquatic humanoids usually have an imaginary friend with a comparable fly or swim Speed. Imaginary friends that appear as animals or mythical creatures replace their imaginary weapons with comparable unarmed attacks that deal force damage.
