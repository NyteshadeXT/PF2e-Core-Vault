Samarans are tiny acorn arboreals that claim to be distant cousins of arboreal regents. These tiny creatures resemble a fist-sized acorn standing on long, twig-like legs. The legs end in two bud-like and prehensile toes. They bear wings like those of a maple seed, hence their name. These wings are not useful for flying, but they can keep a samaran airborne during their long jumps. Most peculiar are the exquisite weapons and armor that samarans create.

Rapiers and scimitars of thorns, lances and halberds of needles, morningstars and hammers of stone fruitsâ€”their jagged armor of all varieties resembles oak, maple, or holly leaves, except that they shimmer in purples and blues that would make any scarab proud. The weapons and armor use metals, leathers, and more unusual materials as well as wood, despite the appearance of these remarkable works. Several samarans might work together to create the large stone swords used by arboreal lords as a sign of fealty.

Though even a kobold laughs to hear these boasts, samarans continue to press their claim to distant kinship with arboreal regents, and in order to reinforce it (whether to convince themselves or others isn't clear), they often pledge themselves in arboreal regents' service. Other arboreals often treat samarans as children as a result. Ancient arboreals rarely recall life as an acorn or nut, so a possibility remains that they are related.

## Second Life

Samaran cultures proscribe any funeral custom except burial. Their bodies sprout into saplings from which future samarans grow, so their graveyards are also their nurseries and communities. The resulting trees grow to the size of maples. Given enough time, samarans believe the trees wake to begin a new life stage, but no documentation of such occurrences exists.
