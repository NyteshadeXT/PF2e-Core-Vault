    desc: "  A celestial geometry begins each encounter attuned to one of five platonic solids, typically blazing tetrahedron, and it can change its attunement each round with Sphere Shift. Depending on its attunement, it gains the defensive abilities stated below, and it can use the corresponding Geometric Evocation.\n\nThe celestial geometry gains the following attunement effects depending on its elemental attunement.\n\n*   **Blazing Tetrahedron** The geometry gains resistance 15 to fire and piercing damage.\n*   **Earthen Hexahedron** The geometry gains resistance 10 to all physical damage.\n*   **Thunderous Octahedron** The geometry gains resistance 15 to electricity and slashing damage.\n*   **Icy Icosahedron** The geometry gains resistance 15 to cold and bludgeoning damage.\n*   **Etheric Dodecahedron** The geometry exposes and reconfigures its core, gaining 12 temporary HP and reducing its [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition to 0 but becoming [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until it uses Sphere Shift to change its attunement."

    desc: "  When using Geometric Evocation, a celestial geometry must target the maximum number of creatures in range, even targeting its allies or itself when necessary, and its emanations affect itself. When targeting itself or affecting itself with its emanation, a celestial geometry takes an additional 2d6 force damage, increases its stupefied condition by 1 (to a maximum of [[undefined]]), and must take the Sphere Shift reaction at the end of its turn."

  - name: "Geometric Evocation"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane) The celestial geometry Casts a Spell depending on its elemental attunement. As normal, the stupefied condition can disrupt the spell. If a spell attack roll is required, Geometric Evocation has the attack trait. All spell attacks made during Geometric Evocation contribute to the celestial geometry's multiple attack penalty, but only after making all of the attacks. Critical success on a spell attack deals double damage, and a failed spell attack misses and deals no damage.\n\n**Blazing Tetrahedron** (fire) The geometry makes spell attack rolls against three creatures within 20 feet, which can't all be in a straight line (their positions must form a triangle instead). On a hit, the creature takes 8d4+16 fire damage. On a critical hit, it also takes 4d4 persistent fire damage.\n\n**Earthen Hexahedron** (earth) Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 6d6+6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save against the celestial geometry's spell DC (Typically DC 37 Reflex check). On a failure, the target is knocked [[undefined]], and on a critical failure it is also [[undefined]] for 1 round. Airborne creatures treat the result of their save as one degree of success better than the result they rolled.\n\n**Etheric Dodecahedron** (cold, fire, earth) Creatures in a 60-foot emanation take 12 fire damage, 12 cold damage, and 12 bludgeoning damage with a a basic Fortitude save against the celestial geometry's spell DC (Typically DC 37 Fortitude check).\n\n**Icy Icosahedron** (cold) The geometry makes a spell attack roll against four creatures within 100 feet. On a hit, creatures take 2d10 + 10 cold and 1d10 + 10 piercing damage; creatures with standard cover or greater cover don't take the piercing damage.\n\n**Thunderous Octahedron** (electricity, sonic) The geometry makes a spell attack roll against four creatures that aren't prone within 40 feet. On a hit, creatures take 2d8 + 8 electricity damage and 2d8 + 8 sonic damage. On a critical hit, they are [[undefined]] for 1 minute."

Celestial geometries are ancient machines whose construction transcends both physical dimensions and human understanding. Though very little is known of their origin, their purpose is clear: they exist to allow someone or something to study the heavens and reveal hidden connections to various planes. It is rumored that celestial geometries could ultimately even divine secrets about the nature of existence and fate.
