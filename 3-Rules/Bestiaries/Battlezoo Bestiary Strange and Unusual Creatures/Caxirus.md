    desc: "  A caxirus's swarm is part of its true self. After defeating a caxirus, its swarm disperses, and 2d4 days later, one of the constituent creatures grows into a new caxirus if even a single one escapes. While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the caxirus's foes have to dispatch the [[undefined]] creatures before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the caxirus collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 Flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the creatures escapes, and the caxirus is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the caxirus."

Reefs are locations full of beautiful and often dangerous life. Unfortunately, many people forget that they are also carefully balanced and fragile ecosystems. Caxiruses are more than happy to violently remind them why they should respect the danger and sanctity of reefs.

A caxirus finds and protects one reef from any who would despoil it, whether intentionally or not. An ambush predator, they most commonly attract interlopers with the flashing bioluminescence of their lure and the swarm of fish that surrounds them. Then, as their prey gets close, they douse the light of their lure and sneak up on their victim while the unsuspecting prey continues to be distracted by the smaller fish.

Caxiruses are experts at ambushing their prey, using the small school of bioluminescent fish that always attends them as a distraction before striking from hiding. More often than not, their victims are so [[undefined]] by the smaller, harmless fish that they never see the main caxirus, with their dangerous teeth and claws, coming.

The main body of a caxirus, in sharp contrast to the sleek fish that make up their swarm, looks much like an anglerfish, complete with a stubby body, toothy maw, and glowing lure. Unlike an anglerfish, a caxirus has a pair of crustacean- like claws instead of pelvic fins, and its eyes sit at the ends of long stalks that it can rotate independently.

Iruses are a family of fey creatures who find beauty in remote places most humanoids and other mortal folk overlook. Unfortunately for those who pass through their domains, they assume anyone in their territory is there to despoil it and react violently.

Each irus is made up of a main body and a swarm of smaller bodies, each with a different physical shape. Both body and swarm are a single creature, however, and an irus can control the smaller bodies as easily as an arm or leg. Should the main body be destroyed, one of the smaller creatures will slowly grow into a new main body.

There is some evidence that all iruses are actually the same species adapted to different environments. For example, a swarm body from one type of irus can cleave off and form a new main body of a different type if it encounters the correct environment.

## Caxiruses And Chochori

While caxiruses ruthlessly hunt any who disrespects their reefs, they are willing to tolerate the presence of the coral people known as chochori, as long as the chochori in question spiritually revere the reef and give regular offerings to the caxirus.

## Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey And Analysis Of The Field

The metaphysical process of swarm rejuvenation is complicated, and among the scholars who sought to understand it, many died to irus attacks before one extremely persistent researcher managed to publish a treatise named Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey and Analysis of the Field, which is currently recognized as the most prominent collection of theories and data on the subject.

According to the text, when an irus's central body is defeated, it spreads the primal energy of its fey self throughout the swarm of creatures that make up its extended body. Each of these creatures is connected to the others and the main body by an invisible web of magical links, similar to arteries or a ley line network, and the web persists after the body's death.

This means that no matter how many of the swarm's constituents are killed, the irus can quickly shift their energy into whichever manages to survive. However, the transfer isn't lossless, and an unpredictable amount of the essence spills out during the process, especially if many of the swarm's constituent creatures also perish. This leads to a significant variation in how long it takes for the irus to rejuvenate, as the more energy it loses, the longer it takes to return.
