  - name: "Cursing Candles"
    desc: "  The lit candles on the boe erchitu's horns allow it to curse its targets, and grant it strength. A creature can attempt to extinguish one of the candles with their fingers using a single action, which has the attack trait to make an unarmed attack roll against the boe erchitu's AC or an Athletics check against the boe erchitu's Reflex DC. Additionally, if the boe erchitu fails a saving throw against a spell with the air or water trait, one of the candles is extinguished; on a critical fail both are extinguished. If no lit candles remain on the boe erchitu's horns, it can't use Bellowing Curse and is [[undefined]] and [[undefined]] until the candles are lit again."

  - name: "Steel Horns"
    desc: "  A creature can target the boe erchitu's horns with a Strike that deals slashing damage to try and cut them both in one Strike. The horns have the same AC as the boe erchitu, and they have Hardness 9 and 36 Hit Points: if not reduced to 0 Hit Points with a single Strike, they are immediately restored to full Hit Points. Performing such a legendary task immediately reverts the boe erchitu to its humanoid form, and frees them from the curse."

  - name: "Charging Curse"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The boe erchitu Strides then makes a horn Strike against a living humanoid creature. On a hit, the boe erchitu uses Bellowing Curse on the target, and on a critical hit, the target's result on their saving throw against Bellowing Curse is one degree of success worse than the one they rolled."

It is said that when an incredibly sinful person indulges in crimes not punishable (or simply unpunished) by mortal law, the power of the divine takes justice into its own hands and curses them to become a boe erchitu under each full moon. Only extinguishing the candles on the steel horns of this white ox can quell its fury, and only cutting the horns themselves with a single hit can free the mortal sinner from this curse.

This distant cousin of the werewolf wanders the streets of its city in a bestial rage, stopping only before the houses of other sinners to curse them as well. Legend says that when the boe erchitu bellows three times before your home, you are destined to die within the coming year. The boe erchitu transformation lasts until dawn, and the curse can't be spread with bites like the curse of the werecreature, although the boe erchitu is able to inflict a milder version with its charge, and silver still works excellently to wound it.

The rescinded horns of a boe erchitu have medicinal properties, and they are especially useful to cure liver illnesses.

A boe erchitu is sometimes seen in the company of imps or other devils, which direct their fury towards the sinners' houses and make sure that their candles are always lit. Could this be a clue that the curse comes from Hell?

## Bidding Frenzy

Priests and cultists of all alignments pay well for the candles of a boe erchitu. Some speculate that dripping their wax on a creature stirs a rage greater than a barbarian's. Others think they summon minotaurs or maybe banish them. All that is known for sure is that the candles have a pleasing raspberry scent.
