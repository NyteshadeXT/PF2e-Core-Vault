    desc: "  When a zweiblade guardian's construct armor is broken, its body splits down the middle, with each half left with a pair of legs but only one arm. In this form, the guardian has two different spaces; each half is a Medium creature. The two halves share a pool of Hit Points and actions per turn, as well as their multiple attack penalty. The zweiblade guardian is [[undefined]] when split, and can use the extra action to Stride, Step, or Strike. If both halves have to save against the same effect, it rolls the save twice and uses the worse result. If both halves take damage from the same effect, they take damage only once, taking the greater amount if the damage isn't the same. The two halves of a split guardian can't stay far apart for long. If the two halves remain separated by over 60 feet for more than 1 minute, one half (randomly determined) permanently loses its animating spark, and the remaining half remains active."

Once a zweiblade guardian is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 26."

It makes two Strikes, one with each of its stone blades, each using its current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target. If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. Add any precision damage only once, to the attack of your choice. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating its multiple attack penalty."

Created to defend against one or many intruders, zweiblade guardians are powerful, imposing constructs that can split apart into two when necessary. Their deadly whirling blades are capable of cutting down solitary foes, and their resilient outer shell inures them from most serious harm.

The true terror one feels when facing these constructs comes when they take enough damage, or when a lucky hit shatters their protective exoskeletons. Without the outer layer binding the interior together, the zweiblade guardian is free to move at full speed, and the truth of its construction is revealed: one animating spark controls two separate bodies.

The guardians take full advantage of their newfound duality, immediately transitioning to flanking tactics or dividing their attention between priority targets. Though each half only has one arm, those arms are more than powerful enough to make a split guardian a dangerous foe. However, the expensive repairs necessary after a split make zweiblade guardians a relatively unpopular choice, reserved primarily for rich eccentrics.

## Two Sides To Every Story

The zweiblade guardian's inventor claimed the kitsune as inspiration, citing their two forms within one body. Little else is known about the inventor due to a lack of other notable creations, leading to speculation that they were a charlatan covering for shoddy construction that caused their regular constructs to split in two.
