Money-grubbers are tiny undead that gather together to pilfer shiny coins. Sightings of the tiny creatures are often dismissed as the ramblings of losing gamblers or forgetful spenders, but everyone living in urban centers haunted by money-grubbers will, one day or later, find their purses lighter than usual because of these pests.

A single money-grubber is completely harmless and simply shooing them away will often be enough to get rid of them. Even if they manage to sneak their way into a purse, they will usually only be able to steal a single coin. Because they always prioritize the shiniest coins, carrying a handful of polished copper pieces is a common and effective practice around communities haunted by money-grubbers.

However, when a great number of money-grubbers gather, they can overwhelm beginner adventurers and steal away all their coins. This usually ends up hurting the novices' pride more than their bodies, but losing the spoils of a recent dungeon delve before getting to spend them can be a career-ending event for many. What these greedy wandering souls do with the coins they steal is unknown, as no money-grubber hoard has ever been found.

## A Spiritual Supplement

The spiritual essence of money-grubbers is strangely nourishing for most undead and spirits, and scholars have claimed to have recorded events of pretty much every kind of spirit eating money-grubbers. Some even say that after consuming money-grubbers in great quantities, even benevolent spirits can be corrupted into powerful undead abominations. The total disregard the money-grubbers have toward anything not carrying coins makes them easy snacks, and stronger spirits sometimes keep a swarm of them around as a quick way to power up when attacked.
