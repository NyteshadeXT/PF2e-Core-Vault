Any result except a critical success on the Medicine check causes the target to take 1d8 persistent bleed damage.

Cadavaliers are the twisted result of the unfettered or undisciplined use of necromantic reanimation spells, where the divide between fallen cavalry and their trusty mounts is all but ignored.

Raised from bloody battlefields, cadavaliers are cultivated from the remnants of cavalry charges ordered in vain by foolhardy commanders, haunted places where the anguish of fallen soldiers resonates, bitter and resentful that they were cut down in their prime. What emerges from these places are hollow vestiges of once-proud warriors astride regal steeds. They become vile mockeries of their former selves, twisted into one horrible composite, and cruelly bound to ride down their animator's foes in relentless pursuit.

While a cadavalier improves upon the speed of their horse's previously living form, their decomposition and cobbled-together nature often cause them to stumble from time to time on their gnarled hooves and twisted bones. Over long stretches, swift-footed adventurers might be able to outpace them.

Though they retain some martial ability from their previous lives, when a cadavalier runs down their quarry at lance point, ultimately the hunger for living flesh overrides what echoes of discipline remain within their shell, and their animalistic side takes control in a bloody frenzy of gnashing teeth and stomping hooves.

## Doppelnayers

While one would not normally greet the sight of a nuckelavee with joy, the fey may mean the difference between life and death when one is being pursued by a cadavalier. Nuckelavees take offense at their appearance, considering cadavaliers to be mockeries of their own form, and become obsessed with destroying any cadavalier they encounter. Just don't stick around to be their next target.
