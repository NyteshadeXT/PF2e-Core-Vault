Vile ascenders are shadowy tricksters who offer tainted gifts that bring others under the vile ascender's will. They are quick to practice their wiles on innocent travelers who venture past their dwellings, pretending to be solitary sages capable of bestowing powerful boons upon those who visit their homes. The more mischievous and enthusiastic vile ascenders actively seek out victims to bestow with their gifts, disguising themselves as gnomes to more easily approach a wider range of potential victims.

Once a vile ascender afflicts a creature with its curse of ascendance, it typically flees, waiting for the target to succumb to its will. The eldest of these vile ascenders retains an entire army of such victims, sending them out into the world to accomplish their bidding. Although they are treacherous, some vile ascenders hire themselves out to powerful beings looking to conscript an army.

## Greed Is Good

Ironically, the most greedy travelers don't succumb to vile ascenders. The curse of ascendance applies to those who accept their gifts, not to those who rob them of all their possessions.
