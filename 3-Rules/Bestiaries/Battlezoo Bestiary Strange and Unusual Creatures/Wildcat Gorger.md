Wildcat gorgers, best known for their almost body-length mouths, are fearsome apex predators of the natural world. One of the larger species of big cats, they rely on brute strength to overwhelm prey, though they also excel at stalking and stealth.

To hunt, wildcat gorgers first stalk their prey before pouncing to engulf them in their maw. Once they have caught a creature in this way, they hold it there until it is entirely digested, making it challenging to use their maw again unless they're willing to lose their current meal. When outnumbered, they first isolate an enemy by swallowing them and then fend off any others with brute strength and vicious claw attacks. 

Though they usually avoid conflicts with bigger creatures, a confrontation is almost inevitable if such creatures remain in a wildcat gorger's territory for any length of time. In these situations, wildcat gorgers usually rely on their strength and assault the creature with unrelenting physical force. The same applies to small groups of adventurers or people traveling within their territory. 

Wildcat gorgers are most commonly found in forests, grasslands, and mountains. They prefer more temperate climates, though they are not unheard of in colder areas. Their coats range from browns to grays depending on their environment, usually with darker stripes. Wildcat gorgers in forested or woodland areas tend to be brown, whereas those in more mountainous terrains tend to be grayer. Like tigers, wildcat gorgers are extremely territorial and often make their dens in caves. After establishing themselves in an area, they rarely leave other than to mate and generally remain there for the rest of their lives. This is partly due to their aggressive nature and unique way of feeding, which make any collaboration or sharing of meals difficult. 

Due to their aggressive and solitary natures, wildcat gorgers seldom mate. When they do, the mother raises the few cubs alone, and even then, only until they're big enough to hold their own in the wild. Thus, often as early as four months old, the cubs have to survive on their own, contributing to their aggressive nature as a means of survival.

## Don't Talk With Your Mouth Full

Wildcat gorgers share similar vocalizations to their smaller feline counterparts, meaning they are prone to hiss when surprised or yowl when faced with an unpleasant situation. Those who are unable to defeat a wildcat gorger may be able to use this tendency to their advantage if the feline swallows one of their companions. A jab at a foot or a leap onto its back can trigger involuntary cries that give the victim a better chance of escaping.
