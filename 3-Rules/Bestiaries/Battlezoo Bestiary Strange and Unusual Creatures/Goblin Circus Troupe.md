    desc: "  Whenever the goblin circus troupe Strides, the troupe first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troupe enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troupe."

Goblin acrobats, bomb jugglers, fire eaters, dog tamers, clowns, and musicians form a goblin circus troupe led by a ringmaster. When left to their own devices, the troupe leaps and cartwheels around, banging their instruments and making an awful noise. Anyone who doesn't applaud loudly enough—and the troupe can't hear much over their din—gets pelted with whatever the goblins have on hand, which usually includes bombs and random circus props.

With their courage bolstered by their numbers, goblin circus troupes love to perform in densely populated human cities where the city watch has difficulty keeping them under control.

## Culture Shock

The number one piece of guidance for those about to experience a goblin circus troupe is: do NOT pelt the troupe with rotten vegetables. Goblin culture considers this expression of displeasure to be a sign of approval instead. Excited troupe members may be so thrilled by the audience participation that they bring offenders into the act. These kidnappings have put a new spin on the concept of running away to join the circus.
