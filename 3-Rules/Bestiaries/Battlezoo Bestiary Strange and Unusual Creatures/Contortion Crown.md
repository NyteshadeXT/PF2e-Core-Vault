The object becomes an extradimensional space with an interior large enough for the creeper to fit inside, regardless of the object's exterior volume. While Inhabiting an object, the contortion crown gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and loses its weakness to slashing damage. The crown remains Inhabiting the object until the object breaks or the crown Inhabits a new object. When not Inhabiting an object, the crown can't use its junk carapace Strike."

The occupying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save against the contortion crown's Athletics DC. On a failed save, a creature is pushed out of the object and to an adjacent square. On a critical failure, a creature is pushed 15 feet away from the object and then the creature falls [[undefined]]."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  With a sweeping motion, the contortion crown Interacts to pick up a Small, Medium, or Large object and Strikes up to two creatures within 10 feet of it using its limb Strike. Its multiple attack penalty does not increase until after it makes both limb Strikes, and its +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls from the sweep trait applies to both Strikes."

  - name: "Throw Junk"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The contortion crown picks up an object within reach (typically a piece of junk) and throws it, making a ranged junk Strike."

A contortion creeper grows slowly as it ages and amasses a collection of pilfered items within its extradimensional space. Magical items within the collection accelerate the process as their power permeates into the creature's body. The rare few that accumulate such a hoard become a massive and dangerous creature that can rapidly conquer a village or small town. Once a creeper becomes large enough to inhabit a small building, insatiable greed drives it to seize any and all objects within its ever-growing reach. Wagons, livestock, monuments, marketplaces, and even small ships become new additions to its hoard. Such a powerful creeper transitions from dwelling to dwelling, driving out inhabitants powerless to stop it. Folk unable to combat the monstrosity must evacuate their homes and eventually abandon their village, which the creeper claims as its dominion. Such tragedies earn this type of creeper the title contortion crown.

* * *

Contortions are a family of aberrations that share a distinctive behavior: like hermit crabs, they find and inhabit discarded objects, which they use as dwellings to protect their vulnerable bodies from harm. However, unlike hermit crabs, contortions tend to inhabit junk found in humanoid settlements rather than shells on the beach. Like hermit crabs, contortions continue to grow and trade up to larger and larger dwellings. While the smallest might live in a shoe, the largest are big enough to inhabit small buildings.

## Contortion Colonies

When a mature contortion creeper or contortion crown comes across a large enough quantity of junk, the glee from this new treasure trove causes polyps to swell up around the base of their arms. Eventually, these polyps explode, releasing a small colony of infant contortions. The members of the colony inhabit the smaller pieces of junk until they grow enough to form a contortion swarm.

## Crown Collaborations

Up to three contortion crowns can collectively dominate an abandoned village or small town, which becomes overrun with their spawn, consisting of contortion swarms and smaller creepers. Each new contortion creeper is born inside an object belonging to its parents' collection. The greed of a contortion crown eventually drives its young out of the home to seek treasures elsewhere. Towns inhabited by multiple contortion crowns often devolve into political battlegrounds between the enormous tyrants.
