If the war tortoise can't act for its entire turn while the dwarven siege crew are reloading the cannons, the team are unable to reload the cannons on that turn, and so it takes 1 additional round before the war tortoise can Fire its Cannons again."

Once the tortoise is reduced to 60 Hit Points or lower, the crew perish, preventing the tortoise from using Fire Cannons."

The problem of mobilizing siege equipment has long plagued armies. Carts are unwieldy and difficult to move over rough terrain, and horses are easily spooked. With careful breeding, desert-dwelling dwarves created an innovative new solution to those problems: an enormous, trained siege turtle known as a war tortoise.

With a tough armored shell, a steady pace, stable footing, and a propensity for ramming things with their heads, war tortoises are perfect siege transports. Their shells are augmented with large decks, which can be outfitted with an array of siege weapons.

Dwarven siege crews train for at least a decade in order to work in perfect tandem with each other and with their war tortoise. This coordination allows them to work together as a single team, similarly to a troop.

## Trendy Dancer

Dwarves experimented with several animals before settling on the tortoise. One contender was the giant desert hare, whose swiftness brought it into contention. That project failed because they had a tendency to drop dead from fright when cannons were fired. Giant scorpions were effective, but siege crews were uneasy about having a massive stinger hanging over their heads. Rocs were too difficult to tame, and elephants were too easy for enemies to hit with return fire. Rumors persist about gargantuan golems that hold crews within their bodies, but military experts insist they are only fanciful tales.
