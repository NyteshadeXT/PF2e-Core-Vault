Kolufs krafsas are mammalian humanoids afflicted with a bizarre curse that transforms them into something else, a pupal stage on the path to something terrifying and new. As a part of that transformation into a nonmammalian creature, all the kolufs krafsa's hair falls out. For ancestries like dwarves that place great value on their thick, lustrous beards, the curse is especially horrifying.

Curiously, kolufs krafsas don't always choose their victims randomly. Despite the burgeoning evil of the curse within them, they prefer to attack those who truly deserve it. Because of that, many kolufs krafsas respond to the pleas of oppressed commoners. A kolufs krafsa listens to those who invoke its name and strikes its victim in the quiet of the night. It carves up its victims, killing the lucky ones as they are free from the creature's curse. Those who survive an encounter with a kolufs krafsa must prepare for sleepless nights, tearing their hair out to the point of exhaustion as their body transforms into a new kolufs krafsa.

## Two Wrongs Don't Make A Right

Some kolufs krafsas seek out werecreatures to bite them. They hope that the new curse will counteract their current one, or at the very least help them grow hair again. Sadly, they just end up doubly cursed, hairless monstrosities who roam the night without even their moral compass for consolation.
