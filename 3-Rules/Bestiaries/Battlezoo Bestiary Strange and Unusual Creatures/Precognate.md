    desc: " (occult) For mindless creatures, precognates are highly adaptive and use unusually complex tactics. However they still have a predictable routine: unless their prey already has a negative condition (such as [[undefined]] or [[undefined]]), precognates' first hostile action each turn is to use Athletics to [[undefined]] or [[undefined]] in order to hamper their prey. Multiple precognates hunting together always select different targets if possible. If its divinations become inactive, such as in an antimagic field, a precognate wanders aimlessly and takes no other actions until its divinations return, and with them, its instincts."

It takes up to three Athletics actions, choosing between [[undefined]], [[undefined]], [[undefined]], or [[undefined]]. The precognate can't use the same Athletics action against the same target more than once during an Efficient Takedown. For example, it can't Trip the same target twice or three times. A precognate's claws can hold up to 3 creatures in a grapple at once, but it can restrain only one of them. The precognate's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after all the checks have been attempted."

The elusive precognate uses potent divination to make up for its lack of a mind. Precognates were originally believed to be highly intelligent beasts with the ability to see into the future, which led to their misleading name. After a group of hunters managed to capture one alive, scholars discovered through an autopsy that precognates not only have no cognitive functions of their own, but they don't even have a centralized mind. Instead, like a jellyfish, their functions are distributed throughout their bodies.

Precognates' powerful divination abilities control their every movement, and thus they are driven by instinct to perform very specific behaviors that seem intelligent at first glance. This extreme level of divinatory magic allows them to avoid a sword strike before the warrior has time to complete the swing. The physical abilities of precognates are quite lopsided. They have lightning- quick reflexes, but most of their athletic prowess comes from targeting weak points that their prey aren't even aware of.

Precognates can be tamed and trained, but not in the same way as creatures with minds can be, since they can't learn and only have their magic to adapt. In the case of precognatess, training progress is more about being keenly aware of how their magical routines work and exploiting them in the trainer's favor. In the wild, precognates are solitary hunters, but they have been reported to sometimes form packs.

## Mission: Incredible

Precognates are in high demand for exploring dungeons and other trap-ridden environments. Their handlers let them loose in different directions and watch carefully as they navigate the safe routes and evade the monsters that might kill any other creature. Precognates are about the same size as most humanoids, so they make better test subjects than smaller beasts, who might avoid a trap simply due to their size. Using a precognate does not guarantee safety, however, as they may anticipate some trigger mechanisms so precisely that they bypass them in subtle ways that are impossible to notice or emulate. Many an overconfident adventuring party has defeated a tomb's guardian only to fall victim to a simple arrow trap.
