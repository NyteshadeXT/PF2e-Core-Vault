Regardless of the area affected or the damage type it mimics, Illusory Attack deals 1d8 mental damage (DC 14 Will check save). A creature that critically succeeds, or a creature with a resistance, immunity, or vulnerability that should apply to the apparent damage type, recognizes that the Illusory Attack is actually an illusion. Such a creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against Illusory Attack."

The transformation lasts for 1 day.\n[[Effects/Effect_ Titanic Transformation|Effect: Titanic Transformation]]"

Despite their name, false tarrasques do not necessarily take the form of tarrasques. The tarrasque is merely their most infamous disguise, since a false tarrasque can take any titanic form they wish. False tarrasques' intelligence may be more primal than scholarly, but they know a surprising amount of information about the most fearsome monsters of the world and use this to shape their disguises, taking the time to learn the best form to take in a given area. Younger and less experienced false tarrasques typically become monstrously large versions of ordinary animals they've seen, such as spiders, snakes, or wolves, while older ones favor either universally feared creatures like ancient dragons or titanic golems or creatures feared in the specific folklore of the region.

The first false tarrasques originally took the shape of jabberwocks. They were granted their powers by a fey lord, who used them to prank her rival by sneaking them into his balls and ceremonies to have them assume their titanic form and terrify all present. She successfully pulled off this prank on six occasions, and on the seventh, she arranged for an actual jabberwock to be teleported in. The utter destruction of her rival's estate and the widescale butchery of all present at the claws of a true beast when her rival expected yet another harmless figment was viewed as both a brilliant political move and a hilarious prank by the survivors.

## Hey, That's Not A Tarrasque

A false tarrasque has numerous tells in its disguise, the most obvious being that despite its size, the false image is often too small. Keen eyes may also note that the fire elemental's flames set nothing alight or the tarrasque's hurled spines vanish after impact. A false tarrasque's inability to speak also betrays any disguise of more sophisticated creatures like dragons. But even so, most people don't have time to notice these small details while they're running away in terror.
