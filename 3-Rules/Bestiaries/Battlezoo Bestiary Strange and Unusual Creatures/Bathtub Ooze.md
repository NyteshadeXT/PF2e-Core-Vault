The bathtub ooze regains an amount of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt to the single creature that took the most damage. Creatures with the water or amphibious trait use the outcome for one degree of success worse than their result. Creatures whose bodies contain no significant moisture (such as fire elementals) are immune to Strip Moisture. The bathtub ooze can't Strip Moisture again for 1d4 rounds."

    desc: "  A bathtub ooze coats any square it moves through with a slick liquid, creating uneven ground. Creatures using an action to move onto the uneven ground must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to [[undefined]], with a DC of 17. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save. The slick surface typically dries after 10 minutes, or immediately when subjected to a fire effect. A bathtub ooze's movements aren't hindered by Slippery Trail."

Bathtub oozes are gray, aqueous blobs that consume magic. A bathtub ooze is typically created through absentmindedness: a mage, deep in contemplation of their arcane thesis, forgets to drain the tub after bathing. Over time, floating skin cells infused with lingering magic cause the ooze to form, a viscous blob of gray water held together by surface tension and shimmering with a subtle purple sparkle. Abandoned and forgotten, the ooze develops a hunger for more magic that manifests in an uncanny sense for approaching auras and drives the ooze to seek out and feed on such sources, stripping the skin off enchanted creatures' flesh in the hopes of ingesting their magic. Bathtub oozes are known to ambush the very mages that created them with their own single-minded neglect, and they're also a terrifying discovery for the unlucky adventurer, thief, or member of household staff who stumbles across them. Bathtub oozes are also surprisingly mobile compared to other oozes, able to compress themselves to squeeze through a keyhole or slide through the gap beneath a door in pursuit of a meal. Exhibiting the same relentless focus as the mage that created them, bathtub oozes doggedly stalk any creature if it senses magic within or upon that creature, grabbing the unfortunate prey with its pseudopod and feeding on its skin until no unconsumed auras of magic remain. Contented, the ooze retreats to its tub and waits patiently for the next meal to present itself.

## The Float Test

Bathing with a duck figurine is a treasured tradition in many cultures, its graceful form bobbing upon the surface of the water with nary a care in the world. Coincidentally, the float test is the quickest method to determine if the water in a tub is merely dirty or an ooze sleeping off its last meal. Drop a duck on an ooze, and it quickly sinks, pulled in by the ooze's voracious body. Drop a duck in dirty water, and it gently floats, silently judging your poor hygiene.
