Keyweeds are small, inconspicuous shrubberies gifted with locomotion and a remarkable ability to fold their leaves and vines. This enables them to manipulate locks and other devices and infiltrate urban environments, which they do gleefully.

Although keyweeds are sapient and are able to communicate fluently in sign language, most keyweeds aren't deeply interested in the politics and societies of the cities they inhabit. They know what interests them, and they stick to that: they seek out the trickiest locks they can find and learn to open them. Then, they use the peculiar vine-twistings required as a mating display. They usually practice this in discreet locations such as abandoned and overgrown buildings, but there are stories of young rogues who seek out these places to watch and learn.

Keyweeds are capable combatants but tend to avoid confrontation, preferring to hide and avoid unnecessary danger. Cornering a keyweed that's been probing one's security measures can be quite difficult. When so cornered, a panicked keyweed often uses their spore puffball in order to create a distraction, allowing them to escape.

The origins of keyweeds are obscure and almost certainly not entirely natural. Legend holds that it was an adventurer-druid who wished to make a point to a roguish friend about how cities had nothing on primal magic. Whether that's true or not, druids have found that keyweeds are quite useful minions. Most keyweeds get along especially well with druids, but even so, they are not beholden to them.

Some thieves' guilds have managed to establish a working relationship with one or more keyweeds, enlisting the keyweeds in heists to serve as safecrackers or lockpickers and paying the keyweeds by giving them special contraptions to play with.

Keyweeds are a family of diminutive plants who are known to perform quirky and unexpected activities, such as breaking into locks, swimming alongside other creatures, or even creating music to calm the spirits of the dead. The name refers to both the family as well as the most famous member of the family, the creature known as keyweed, a plant that loves to pick locks and disable devices.

While keyweeds' origin aren't entirely clear, many scholars have come to believe the most widely spread legends, which tell that keyweeds were created by druids to fulfill a variety of unusual niches where no other plants possibly could. Other theories exist, including those of some scholars who believe that keyweeds were originally humanoids who transformed into plants due to the blessing or curse of a deity of nature. For instance, one fairy tale parents tell to little children who are caught filching something is that if they misbehave and steal from others, the Green Man might come to the house at night and transform them into a keyweed, spiriting them away into the woods forever, never to see their families again.

Keyweeds have an unusual relationship with leshies based on their similarities and differences. Both are small sapient plant creatures, and if the stories are true, both originated from druidic magic, but leshies are nature spirits, or vitae, that directly incarnated in a mortal plant body through a primal ritual. While their progenitors might have been created by druids, keyweeds are mortal plants through and through, living, reproducing, and dying just like any other plant does.

## Keyweed Companionship

While younger keyweeds that haven't yet become convolute tend to remain separated from the complexities of intrigue, they are still more social than some other kinds of plant creatures and enjoy companionship, both with other plants as well as non-plants. Keyweeds especially enjoy hanging out with druids and other creatures with primal magic. Companions who've spent time with a keyweed often find their new friend's perspective unusual and difficult to predict, though sometimes quite refreshing compared to what they are used to encountering. Adventuring companions consider keyweeds' skills especially useful, as locks, traps, and devices can prove an impediment to parties without a rogue or other expert in those types of impediments. Slowly, keyweeds learn more about the world around them from their companions, which aids them in the growth (both physical and psychological) that they need in order to become a convolute keyweed some day. By exposing themselves to a broad variety of perspectives, they increase their rate of growth and ensure that they will become especially well-respected among the ranks of convolute keyweeds.

## Keyweed Keepsakes

Keyweeds sometimes like to keep physical mementos of their past accomplishments, such as hanging onto the first lock they ever picked or something from inside the first safe they cracked. These can lead an adventurer to come across a bewildering trove of otherwise unrelated knickknacks.
