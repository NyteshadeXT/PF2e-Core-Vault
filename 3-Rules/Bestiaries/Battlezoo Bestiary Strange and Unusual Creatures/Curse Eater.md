Any non-artifact cursed item whose curse is counteracted crumbles into dust. The curse eater has a counteract modifier of +28 and a counteract level of 6th for this reaction.

Curse eaters are natural predators of werecreatures, oracles, and the accursed, who feed almost entirely off of curses. These two-headed creatures appear like long, twisted werehyenas, each head snapping and snarling. Though some cursed creatures might seek out a curse eater as a possible cure, it's also possible that a curse eater might maul and devour an accursed creature even after it consumes the curse.

Despite their violent nature, curse eaters tend to leave uncursed creatures who stay out of their way alone, and communities besieged by evil werecreatures or other cursed monsters often see the appearance of a curse eater as a blessing. On the other hand, werecreatures deeply fear and hate curse eaters, and so do members of communities that willingly host or rely upon werecreatures or curses. Superstitious communities, particularly those of pragmatic gnolls, sometimes team up with a curse eater, planting curses on the gnolls' next victims and thus offering the curse eater their favorite meals in exchange for assistance in the battle.

It is unknown when or how curse eaters reproduce; there exist many folktales and stories of abjurers obsessed with curing an incurable curse and then being turned into these monsters due to their hubris, either as some sort of divine punishment or as the result of magical experimentation gone wrong, but if this is their true origin, no verifiable example of such an incident actually occurring is currently known.

## Glutton For Punishment

Curse eaters often face feast or famine, so they enter a feeding frenzy when they find a bounty of curses, and their physiology stores the excess for later digestion. Adventurers who encounter a bloated curse eater would do well to steer clear, for the undigested curses need somewhere to go if the curse eater diesâ€¦
