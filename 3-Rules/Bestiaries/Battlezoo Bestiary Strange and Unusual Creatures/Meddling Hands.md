A writhing mass of arms and hands animated by the concentrated embodiment of a trickster god's capacity for cleverness, manual dexterity, and skill, the strange beings known as meddling hands are exceptional infiltrators and dangerous opponents. While they are incredibly intelligent, meddling hands don't communicate via language, and their methods and reasoning are as inscrutable as the god from which they attained life. So far as any can tell, they perform actions at the whims of their deific progenitor as an extension of some unknowable scheme.

Meddling Hands appear to be massive, semi-upright writhing masses of arms and hands, interlocking to create "limbs" and something resembling a face.

Trickster echoes are fragments left behind due to the actions of a powerful trickster deity, drifting throughout the universe in the wake of the trickster's mischief. Tricksters are a popular archetype among the many different deities across the world's various pantheons and cultures. Traditionally, trickster deities take many forms, using their disguises and deceptions to bewilder, confuse, and mislead all those around them. Why trickster deities continually deceive all those around them varies from trickster to trickster. Some tricksters are compulsive liars. Others have an agenda they seek to pursue or simply find the idea of successfully pulling off pranks exhilarating or hilarious. Still other tricksters flit between moral codes, attempting to join with heroic deities for a time, only to inevitably betray their allies, or even their siblings, in a series of countless shifting adjustments of allegiance.

Disguises are a big part of the reason mortals and other deities alike can't help but continue engaging with trickster deities, as they might never come to realize exactly with whom they are dealing or only discover that the mysterious figure offering advice was a trickster after it was too late. However, deception alone isn't sufficient. Tricksters tend to be legitimately multi-talented in a variety of different skills, with incredible talent and unparalleled techniques. Thus, before their sudden but inevitable betrayal, a trickster is a superlative ally, capable of achieving all sorts of impossible feats on behalf of their allies, deific or otherwise.

When trickster deities perform an especially notable prank, betrayal, or other act of mischief, they might leave behind a powerful echo, known as a trickster echo. Depending on the trickster's actions and physicality, various sorts of trickster echoes congeal or coagulate. For instance, a trickster's skills and clever nature can give rise to a meddling hands, while a trickster's lies, alongside its deceptive tongue and facial features, lead to the birth of a many faces. A thousand skins slough off when a trickster changes guises between various forms in order to mislead all around them or ruin another's reputation. Meanwhile, the mindless malice of a trickster deity's laughter births a congealed laughter.

## Idle Hands

While meddling hands supposedly act in unexpected ways to enact a secret scheme related to their progenitor's own goals, most tricksters don't have continual work for their meddling hands to perform at all times. This leaves meddling hands to their own devices for a time before the trickster calls them back to the next phase of the plan. While meddling hands often use their spare time to enact tricks and pranks of their own, they sometimes just want to work with their hands and take up various tasks in earnest, performing them to the best of their abilities.

## Trickster's Trail

Adventurers who find themselves at odds with a trickster, chasing after the deity's trail of plots and schemes, often find their path obstructed by a variety of foes thrown in their way by the trickster deity themselves. Chief among these opponents are the trickster echoes, whether they arise naturally and inadvertently through the trickster's actions or the trickster intentionally creates them in order to oppose those who threaten to catch them in the act.

This could lead to an entire adventure or campaign: First, the adventurers challenge the meddling hands setting up the trickster's schemes. Then come across a congealed laughter while the trickster chortles with glee as their plans near completion. As the adventurers begin to unravel the trickster's lies, they come face to face (or perhaps face to faces?) with a many faces. Before they have grown strong enough to challenge the trickster directly, the trickster sends a thousand skins to finish them off. Finally, the adventurers confront the trickster to solve this cosmic jest once and for all.
