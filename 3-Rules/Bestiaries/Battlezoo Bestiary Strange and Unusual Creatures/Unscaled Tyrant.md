Sometimes a kobold hatchling stands out due to extreme latent magical ability. When spellcasters in the young kobold's community recognize this, they tend to mark the hatchling for greatness and future leadership. However, on rare occasions, this destined leader is murdered prematurely, whether by their own jealous clutch-mates, monstrous rivals, or even the community's own paranoid leader. If the would-be ruler's body is not destroyed utterly, their eternal desire to lead could cause the soul of the young kobold to rise as an unscaled tyrant, continuing their pursuit of greatness stolen from them by an early death.

After killing a few stray kobolds and demonstrating the ability to command the undead, most unscaled tyrants are able to take control of their community. Communities of kobolds ruled by an unscaled tyrant often become brutal but murderously efficient, and their brutality and efficiency both increase as the number of living kobolds plunges.

Unscaled tyrants usually lead from the rear, letting both their living and dead kobold brethren do their dirty work. Often, opponents fighting these kobolds or undead might not even realize a tiny undead kobold is controlling their opposition. These unfortunate souls might have a difficult time living long enough to realize their mistake.

While unscaled tyrants are fairly rare, even among kobolds, whispers of similar undead for other ancestries are rumored.

## Keep Your Enemies Close

Unscaled tyrants often keep the ones who murdered them as their lieutenants. They revel in making their former foes obey their whims and reanimating them after defeats to suffer further humiliation. Sometimes tyrants gain so much amusement watching enemies kill these lieutenants that they become distracted and lower their guard to attacks against themselves.
