The world of fey-operated fine dining attracts a lucrative clientele, and the most affluent customers demand full service that only a silversmyf can provide. While lesser staff members and coppersmyfs might merely ferry ingredients back and forth from the fey realm, silversmyfs have the enviable distinction of bringing and serving the rarest prepared delicacies directly to discerning patrons, wherever they might be.

A disanimated silversmyf presents itself as a fancy silver serving tray capped with an intricately engraved cloche. It also consists of ten pieces of silverware, usually five forks and five knives, but different silversmyfs have different combinations of utensils. A silversmyf prides itself on never leaving the table untidy and fusses to reposition the serving ware and table d√©cor, sometimes to the wait staff's vexation.

When a silversmyf reanimates, it forms a crab-like creature with a glowing white eye, with the tray and clouche acting as a body and the silverware acting as appendages. Though they do not speak, silversmyfs are cordial and comport themselves with the utmost decorum, bowing to patrons as they deliver their extravagant meals.

As decorous and polite as silversmyfs are while they are within their establishment, while en route to deliver their delicacies, they defend their exotic dishes with violent attacks. Using their bodies and silverware appendages, silversmyfs shoot thieves with freezing beams and throw grenades of crushed ice at them to slow their escape. The silversmyf's delicious cargo is premade food with a limited shelf life, but as long as these gustatory delights are sold right away, they could be quite valuable.

Smyfs are a family of fey constructs, with bodies forged of disparate pieces of mundane equipment connected into a single entity by strands of primal energy. Each type of smyf serves a different role at restaurants connected to the realm of the fey. Coppersmyfs handle the venue and gather supplies; silversmyfs serve food to guests; and goldsmyfs protect the restaurant's finances. Together, they lend fey restaurants a unique style while guarding customers and staff alike. Their names arise from the type of object used to form their bodies: copper pots and bowls for a coppersmyf, silverware for a silversmyf, and gold coins for a goldsmyf.

## Silversmyf Hospitality

Silversmyfs never fail to be courteous to a guest, even though they are ruthless when it comes to guarding their customers' meals. When it isn't clear whether an intruder will eventually prove to be a customer or a larcenous bandit, silversmyfs typically default to a polite approach. After all, if they do so, in the worst case, they act with excessive decorum toward a criminal, whereas if they default away from a polite attitude, they might commit the grave sin of offending a guest.

## Other Smyfs

Smyfs aren't especially common to begin with, and of those, only coppersmyfs, silversmyfs, and goldsmyfs are seen on any kind of regular basis, even in the relatively obscure niche of fey restaurants. However, these aren't the only kinds of smyfs that exist. The following smyfs exist at least in stories and faerie texts, though whether they are fabricated or simply quite rare is still unknown.

*   **Platinumsmyfs**, whose enormous bodies include a furnace, are capable of cooking up new recipes.
*   **Electrumsmyfs** accompany silversmyfs or coppersmyfs on journeys delivering rare delicacies or purchasing ingredients in order to ensure appropriate payment and protect the payment on its return.
*   **Mithralsmyfs** are supposedly an advanced form of silversmyf, created to deliver especially perishable goods quickly, particularly when their destination is far away or in a dangerous area.
*   **Orichalcumsmyfs**, only mentioned in legends, coordinate all other smyfs across a vast restaurant empire, using their mastery over temporal magic and time management in order to manage dozens or even hundreds of other smyfs.
