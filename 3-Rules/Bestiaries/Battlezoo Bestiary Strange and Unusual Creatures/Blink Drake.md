    desc: "  A blink drake gains greater effects from teleportation magic. It can teleport up to twice the usual range with its teleportation spells, and if an effect would cause the drake to teleport to a space not of the drake's choosing (including from its own _Blink_ spell), the drake can instead choose any valid space within range to appear, or choose not to teleport. In order to subvert a foe's teleportation effect in this way, the drake must succeed at a counteract check with a counteract level of 6 and a counteract modifier of +20."

It increases its resistance to all damage except force from _Blink_ against the triggering attack from 8 to 24. After the attack is resolved, the drake then teleports to an open space within 10 feet."

Every creature adjacent to the drake must attempt a DC 27 Reflex check save against 2d6 force damage. A creature that critically fails this save is teleported 10 feet in a random direction (similarly to the effects of Sustaining a blink spell)."

  - name: "Warping Breath"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,teleportation) The blink drake spits a ball of barely-restrained teleportation magic up to 60 feet that explodes into a 20-foot burst of rending micro-portals. Those in the burst take 10d6 force damage with a DC 30 Reflex check save). The portals remain for 1d4 rounds as difficult terrain, and any creature that ends their turn in the area while they remain takes 3d6 force damage with a DC 27 Reflex check save. The blink drake can't use Warping Breath while the portals remain."

Blink drakes are dragons infused with teleportation magic. Their personalities and behaviors vary wildly. While some blink drakes are capricious and playful, playing pranks and stealing as suits their whims, others are vicious and aggressive, using their teleportation abilities to methodically assassinate their foes. Blink drakes are small, even compared to their weaker drake cousins—barely the size of a human—but their magical powers make them a dangerous and elusive foe. Those who would face a blink drake are advised to either bring force effects or else some kind of magic to prevent the creature's constant teleportation.

## Mutable Minds

Blink drakes' bodies are in constant flux from their incessant blinking, but that leaves their minds as their greatest weakness. Some scholars believe that blink drakes are more affected by mental attacks because they had to evolve mutable minds to keep up with everyday life while blinking. Others wonder whether someone or something might have been responsible for originally infusing blink drakes with magic and if that mysterious entity built in a weakness to exploit.
