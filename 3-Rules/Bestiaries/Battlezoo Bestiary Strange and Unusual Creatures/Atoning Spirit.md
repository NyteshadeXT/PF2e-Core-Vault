Whether the agent of a deity, the embodiment of a holiday, or a fey spirit seeking to teach mortals a lesson, an atoning spirit appears to those in need, whether they want its aid or not. An atoning spirit's goal isn't to harm their target but instead to convince them to atone for their sins. They use powerful illusions and insights into the target's life to show their target visions of their lives that led to the transgressions and caught the atoning spirit's attention.

An atoning spirit may appear in any form it likes, but they often choose that of someone close to the target: a deceased friend or relative, or an older or younger version of the target itself.

A person can attract the attention of an atoning spirit either through the performance of an atone ritual or by encountering an atoning spirit and behaving in a way that makes the spirit believe they're seeking atonement. The atoning spirit leaves once the creature has either properly atoned for its sins or sincerely no longer wishes to atone.

## False Witness

Sometimes, when friends and family have had enough of a loved one's misbehavior, they'll hire a caster or just dress themselves up to impersonate an atoning spirit in hopes of changing the reprobate's ways. This type of intervention rarely has the lasting effects of proper atonement and sometimes suffers the awkwardness of an actual atoning spirit showing up to disapprove of the falsehood.
