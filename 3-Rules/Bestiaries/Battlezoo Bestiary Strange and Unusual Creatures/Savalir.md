Lethal and adaptive hunters of the dark caverns of the world, savalirs originated from an order of drow assassins who sought advantage in bizarre and experimental alchemical elixirs. Centuries of consuming these unstable admixtures made them faster, stronger, and more resilient than their targets and competitors alike, but at a terrible cost. These projects of self-induced evolution in pursuit of ever more perfect murder warped their bodies and minds, and modern savalirs are now fleshwarps of their own making, unrecognizable as the elves they once were. Though they were long ago driven out of drow society, their alchemical traditions have been literally internalized, as savalirs possess specialized organs that can flood their systems with alchemical concoctions created on the fly.

Savalirs are vicious and murderous to a fault, but their services can still be hired for difficult assassinations since they appreciate a challenge. Prospective employers must be extremely cautious with these arrangements, as savalirs would gleefully betray those who hired them at the first sign of weakness. Savalirs hunt alone or in small packs, but remain aware of the location of drow communities. As alchemically evolved beings, savalirs are incapable of biological reproduction and so they kidnap drow rather than slay them outright. This is a matter of self-interest, not mercyâ€”savalirs inject their captives with alchemical cocktails over the course of several months, slowly warping their unfortunate victims into new savalirs.

## Training Day

Savalirs pride themselves on their independence and only create new ones if they spot an especially promising drow or are growing old. They teach these new savalirs everything they know with the expectation that these apprenticeships end with either the student or teacher assassinating the other. It is rare for both to escape alive.
