Formerly ordinary, three-dimensional people, the between are two-dimensional beings that have had one of their dimensions annihilated in an arcane cataclysm. Twisted into malevolence by existing on a level of reality their minds are unable to comprehend, the between yearn for what they can no longer perceive. Their interaction with the rest of the world is limited, but they are convinced that if they were able to drag a three-dimensional creature to their level and steal one of that creature's dimensions, they could return to their former selves.

The between's true form is difficult for a three-dimensional being to see or understand, appearing as a strangely undulating wave of energy to the naked eye. Occasionally, grasping arms and anguished faces form in the wave as it gets closer to three-dimensional corporeality, if just for a moment.

The between are typically found roaming the ruins of their former homes, but from time to time they wander further in search of victims, leaving destruction in their wake. Made of energy that manifests as heat in the physical world, a between burns everything with a single touch.

## A Fate Worse Than…

Another outcome of an arcane cataclysm is becoming a fixed, where a creature loses the fourth dimension of time. It becomes stuck, immovable, and unchangeable through all of the past, present, and future. Mages speculate that introducing a between to a fixed could help both, but fixed are difficult to locate because the universe is always moving and changing, while fixed never, ever, change.
