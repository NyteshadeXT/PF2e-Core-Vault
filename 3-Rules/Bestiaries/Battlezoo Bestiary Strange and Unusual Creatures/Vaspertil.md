If Proliferate is triggered by vigorous acquisition, the new arms might resemble one of the targeted creature's limbs. If the vaspertil ever reaches full Hit Points, all its wounds close and the proliferated arms fall dead to the ground, which additionally ends any ongoing benefits of vigorous acquisition."

  - name: "Vigorous Aquisition"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The vaspertil has temporary hit points from drain life and is able to use Proliferate\n* * *\n\n**Effect** With a swift motion the vaspertil cuts into its own flesh, dealing 1d6 slashing damage. If the vaspertil successfully Proliferates from this slashing damage, the creature most recently drained by drain life must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude check saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** Until the end of the its next turn, the vaspertil gains the benefit of one of the targeted creature's feats, chosen by the GM, and the target loses the benefits of the acquired feat. The GM should typically choose a feat the vaspertil would be capable of using, a feat on which the target overrelies, or preferably both.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the vaspertil steals the benefits of two feats, and the effect lasts as long as the vaspertil has temporary Hit Points or until the end of the vaspertil's next turn, whichever is longer. At the end of each of the vaspertil's turns, starting from its next turn, the targeted creature can attempt a new saving throw against vigorous acquisition.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, but the vaspertil steals the benefit of three feats and the effects persists for 1 minute. At the end of each of the vaspertil's turns, starting from its next turn."

Vaspertil are mirrors of potential, a clean slate: demons who decided to follow a path of redemption. Whether through summons or of their own volition, vaspertil seek out those who pride themselves on their powers and talents and force them to question what really defines them.

While atoning for their fiendish nature has left vaspertils faceless and mutilated, dismissing their abyssal roots has also introduced a sense of appreciation to their existence, one that is usually only acquired by the loss of something previously taken for granted.

Despite being telepathic, vaspertils almost exclusively communicate through body language.

## Til We Meet Again

Vaspertils consider their battles to be tests of their foes. Those able to defeat a vaspertil in fair combat earn its respect and a boon appropriate to vaspertil philosophy. They may be willing to join a quest that confronts an adventurer's fears or provide information against abyssal threats. Vaspertils won't fight people's battles for them but are willing to help them supplement and overcome their weaknesses.
