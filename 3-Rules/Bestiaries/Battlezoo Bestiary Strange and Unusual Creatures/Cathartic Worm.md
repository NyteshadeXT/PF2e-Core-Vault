Cathartic worms are dragons of the fey realm that act as emotional vampires, feeding on the emotions of those around them.

Cathartic worms don't attack most creatures on sight. Instead, they follow their prey from the air at a distance, ensuring that their target experiences strong emotions so the cathartic worm can feed. They don't care what emotion or collection of emotions their victim feels, as long as the emotions are strong. When a cathartic worm feeds on a victim's emotions, they do so from a distance, using their aura to pacify their victim and make the process of feeding simpler and safer for the cathartic worm. Victims rarely even understand what happened, often feeling calm and even-keeled after a feeding has occurred. Cathartic worms rarely kill their victims, since they have no need to do so, though folk tales describe the most violent of feedings as leaving victims with their minds shattered.

## Party Crashers

Celebrations are especially tempting targets for cathartic worms due to the concentration of elevated emotions. Large gatherings in the fey realm may attract multiple such dragons to their periphery, where precautions must be taken to prevent them from disrupting the event. The most effective technique is to meet the cathartic worms away from the party and cast spells that elicit strong emotions in volunteers to distract the worms. The cathartic worms don't try too hard to circumvent these defenses, for they know that such distractions are simply appetizers. Sooner or later, the organizers will voluntarily let them in for the main course because nothing says the party's over like all the joy being literally sucked out of the room.
