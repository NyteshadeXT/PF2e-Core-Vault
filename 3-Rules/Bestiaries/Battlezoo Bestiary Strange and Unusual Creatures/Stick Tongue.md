    desc: "  A stick tongue leverages foliage to shield and obscure itself. It can always Take Cover while in a tree and gains the benefits of Take Cover in a tree regardless of positioning or line of sight. It prefers to have greater cover as often as possible, by choosing positions that would normally grant cover without the use of this ability. If a stick tongue uses Stealth for initiative while in a tree, it uses Take Cover as part of rolling initiative."

To the unsuspecting goblin, a stick tongue is the enormous tongue that snapped out of a tree's foliage, wrapped itself around their armpits, and snatched them up forever. In reality, they are large mantids with numerous joints that allow them to navigate tree foliage nimbly and a toad-like tongue that lets them reach their prey below. A stick tongue's limbs are often thicker than the branches, and they are covered in small, often scaly growths that resemble the leaves of their favorite trees.

Their natural camouflage varies between regions. They may have a sappy, rotting bark appearance in haunted forests full of dead or undead trees or have lush green, feathery growths to sway alongside a willow tree or even large, bushy leaves in tropical environments.

## Don't Lick That

Travelers in regions where stick tongues live try various tricks to protect themselves. The most common involve wearing tearaway clothing or coating their armor in slick oil, but other strategies aim to make themselves less appetizing targets. Some carry pouches of ground chili peppers, thinking the spiciness might stun the tongue. Other folk tales say that the smell of peppermint sickens the creatures, preventing them from swallowing. Which strategies work best is unknown and may vary depending on the unique tastes of each stick tongue.
