    desc: "`pf2:1` (mental,occult,visual) The bowlfish erupts in a wonderful and complex dance, immediately drawing the attention of all those around it to its bizarre antics. Every creature in a 30 foot radius becomes [[undefined]], unless they succeed at a DC 17 Will check save. A creature that fails its saving throw against a bowlfish's Fish Dance ability stays fascinated this way as long as the bowlfish continues to spend one action to Fish Dance each turn to keep dancing, without receiving any further saving throws, although the fascination can be broken normally by hostile actions. Creatures fascinated by a bowlfish's Fish Dance must spend the first action on each of their turns approaching the bowlfish, and they must instead spend all of their actions approaching the bowlfish if they critically failed their Will save against the bowlfish's Fish Dance."

What would appear as an unassuming yet lively goldfish in a transparent glass bowl is in fact a devious and cunning creature that feeds on those who fall for its ruse. The glass bowl itself is in fact a part of its body, and it's soft and warm to the touch, but usually it's too late for anyone to notice this fact. The "goldfish" inside is actually the head of the creature, and it can spring forward to bite its prey with a very large mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth, much like a piranha.

When a bowlfish is digesting prey, the "water" inside the bowlfish's namesake bowl turns a murky red with blood as bits and pieces of its last meal swirl around. After a few minutes, the digestion process completes, and its body becomes crystal clear once again. However, during that time, the bowlfish is especially vulnerable to exposure if a potential witness comes across what seems to be an inexplicably gory fish bowl. Thus, bowlfish try to ensure they can digest their food unmolested by picking off victims who are alone, who have become vulnerable in an obscure location, or who have entered the bowlfish's room at a time when few others would be likely to interfere with their meal.

Rumors say that unscrupulous wizards created the first bowlfish to be sold as exotic "pets, " with different shapes of bowl and varieties of fish to obscure the truth even from those who are aware of the existence of bowlfish.

Bowlfish like to use their harmless appearance to their advantage. They often choose a single pawn around whom they always act like nothing more than a fish in a bowl. This leads their pawn to keep them around as a pet, not realizing that they're hosting a vicious killer in their home. Less scrupulous partners who understand a bowlfish's true nature might use it to intentionally murder others, inviting them into close quarters with the creature so they can collect valuables from the dead. Bowlfish can seldom be found in the wild, where this disguise is not very effective, and thus they have the tendency to avoid rural settings.

## He's Just Resting

A dead bowlfish does not maintain its form and resembles a jellyfish out of water, much to the dismay of macabre collectors who wish to use its corpse as a novelty fish bowl. Some have found success, however, in decapitating the bowlfish, reanimating its head, and keeping the resulting "fish" as a pet.
