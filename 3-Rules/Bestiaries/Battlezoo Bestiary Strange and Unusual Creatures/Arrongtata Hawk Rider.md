The arrongtata hawk rider Flies up to half its Speed, makes a longspear Strike and talon Strike, each against the same target, then Flies up to half its Speed again to return to its original location. If either Strike is a critical hit, the target is also [[undefined]] for 1 round. The second movement doesn't trigger reactions. Both attacks count toward the arrongtata hawk rider's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it makes both attacks."

An arrongtata hawk rider is an arrongtata who forms a bond with a hawk mount, cohesively working as one fighting unit. Arrongtata's constant study of warfare eventually led to the pursuit of aerial units in order to diversify their military capabilities. Certain arrongtata spend a significant amount of time to form a bond with a wild hawk, befriend it, and train the bird to be their mount. These arrongtata have fully melded themselves and their hawk allies into a single entity to ensure their success. They hang their detachable faces around their mount's neck, and their ability to telepathically connect to their mount allows them to flawlessly become a single creature and look in all directions at once.

Arrongtata hawk riders trade out the traditional arrongtata spear for a tiny longspear and javelins. Arrongtata riders become so connected to their hawks that dismounting them is as difficult as severing a limb from another creature. In the rare circumstance that an arrongtata hawk rider somehow does become dismounted, the rider usually dies from the fall or the sudden disconnect. Arrongtata hawk riders often fight alongside a number of arrongtata swarms commanded by an arrongtata commander.

* * *

Arrongtata were once kami who forsook their wards to seek out trespassers on sacred grounds. Abandoning their duty as kami allowed them to roam freely, but while they weren't punished nearly as harshly as oni, their choice still cost them their vision and most of their magical powers. To overcome this, arrongtata bound their bodies to a shield face that they crafted from natural materials. Arrongtata are hostile to any creature they believe will harm nature, though they get along surprisingly well with non-evil oni, as the two can empathize with each other's pasts, their choices, and the overly harsh punishments they've received. If their shield face is destroyed, they can craft a new one in a week, and it is sturdy enough to be used as shield material by those who manage to defeat them.

## Reading Faces

The material an arrongtata uses to craft a shield face carries personal significance. Most choose a material matching what they defended as kami, though others select something they wish to protect in their new roles. Front-line fighters often have faces made of hardy wood or metal for better protection. Strategists have rock faces that channel the wisdom of the earth, while grass or fur faces help scouts blend into their environments. But the most fearsome arrongtata are those with bone facesâ€”they are spirits of vengeance with nothing left to lose, for all they sought to defend has died.
