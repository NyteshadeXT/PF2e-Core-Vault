Although considered macabre by some, the creation of the _hand of the mage_ magic item requires the use of a severed hand, generally sourced from a deceased arcane spellcaster. Sometimes, however, the dead aren't so content with being robbed, especially of a part of their body. When a handless mage rises from their grave, they won't rest until their corpse is returned to its original state.

A handless mage is always paired with a specific _hand of the mage_, and since the handless mage rose from its grave only to return what was stolen, they spend their time searching endlessly for it in often futile attempts to recover it. Only after they've righted this wrong can a handless mage rest, gladly moving on to the afterlife.

While some handless mages may resort to physical violence against those who hold their specific hand of the mage, others are more than content to trade what few goods or services they can offer for their missing extremity. Depending on the mage, they might consider parting with a magic staff or, in some rare cases, their old spell book.

## Handy-dandy Trade

No small number of people have found success asking a handless mage to obtain another _hand of the mage_ to trade for their own hand back.
