    desc: "`pf2:3` (mental,visual) The wannabe knight points at a foe, usually the strongest looking creature it can see, issuing a challenge to single combat. That creature can choose whether to accept. If the creature denies the challenge, the wannabe knight wins by default. If the creature accepts, both it and the knight gain 50 temporary Hit Points, which only protect them from damage they each deal to the other. They can only attack each other for the duration of the challenge and if any ally assists the challenged opponent, the challenged opponent forfeits and loses. When either combatant reduces the other's temporary Hit Points from Issue Challenge to 0, they are the victor and gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute. Additionally if the wannabe knight wins, its opponent becomes Frightened 2. Afterward, the challenged creature is temporarily immune for 1 month.\n[[Effects/Effect_ Issue Challenge (Participants)|Effect: Issue Challenge (Participants)]]\n[[Effects/Effect_ Issue Challenge (Victor)|Effect: Issue Challenge (Victor)]]"

  - name: "Mount Up"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The wannabe knight creates a growth that extends below it and out of its armor to form a mount, which typically resembles a featureless black horse whose shape is slightly off. While \"mounted,\" the wannabe knight's size increases to Large, it gains a +20-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed, and it takes a â€“2 penalty to its AC."

  - name: "Pseudopod Weapons"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) The wannabe knight forms a pseudopod that appears to be a lance or bastard sword held in its hand. The weaponized pseudopod remains until it uses this action again to change its type or remove it. The wannabe knight's pseudopods are limited to one at a time, and while wielding its shield, it can spare only one \"hand\" for the pseudopod weapons; this means it deals d8 damage from the bastard sword pseudopod and can only use the lance pseudopod when mounted via Mount Up with the jousting trait. Without the shield, it can deal d12 damage with the bastard sword pseudopod and use the lance pseudopod in both hands for its full damage."

  - name: "Whirlwind Charge"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The wannabe knight Strides up to twice its Speed in a straight line and can make a Strike against each foe within its reach throughout the movement. These attacks increase its multiple attack penalty, but only after the Whirlwind Charge is complete."

Wannabe knights appear as regal knights clad in shining armor with a lance at their side. However, upon closer inspection, it has glistening black ooze creeping out of its armor. More jarring yet is the knight's "steed," which is composed of nothing more than the same black ooze that makes up its body.

Wannabe knights are huge fans of tales of knights and chivalry, so they try to stick to the code that the knights of legend supposedly follow. Acting like a silent knight out of a storybook, wannabe knights value a fair fight and accept the challenge of battle to prove their skill. Far too often, a wannabe's need for glory leads it to attack the actual heroes it encounters. Other times, a wannabe knight might pledge its sword to an entity that convinces it to serve and protect an area.

## My Kingdom For A Horse

Some equipment goes further for wannabe knights than others. Knights welcome new armor but find their own pseudopods to be sufficient weaponry. Their greatest desire is a real horse, which frees their form to create longer weapons and extend their reach. The horse becomes the knight's best friend, receiving doting care. Losing the steed is devastating, though, and many veteran wannabe knights never seek out a replacement as the pain of losing their original mount is simply too great to experience again.
