Proselytizers are the scouts and spies of velstrac society. They scour the land, spreading their philosophy of pain and pleasure to all who are willing to listen. Thanks to their dark robe shrouding their velstrac features, at first glance, they can appear like a normal humanoid. This allows them to blend into a settlement, greatly aiding in clandestinely converting others to their cause.

For those who are hesitant to consider the gifts the proselytizer has to offer, the proselytizer can have them share in experiencing excruciating pain by forcing them to touch the proselytizer's chain while the proselytizer maims themselves. This experience oftentimes leaves the victim unconscious but forever changed, as they now know the limits of pain and are no longer bound by them.

## Let Us Prey

A proselytizer's appeal may seem strange until one understands that those who convert are often people who are already in pain. Proselytizers seek out the vulnerable in society who do not see an end to their suffering and instead offer them faith that their experience serves a greater purpose. A community that defeats a proselytizer would do well to recover its chains. The links retain the ability for a creature to experience another's pain. They may be sold to bounty hunters, who use them to ensure their prisoners do not attack them. Yet they do not have to be used for punishment and can instead promote empathy by allowing people to learn how someone else feels.
