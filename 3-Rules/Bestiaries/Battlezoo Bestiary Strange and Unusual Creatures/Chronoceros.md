At first glance, a chronoceros resembles a regular rhinoceros, except that it has five eyes â€”one pair on the side of its head, one pair under its mane of hair, and one in the middle of its forehead. While the creature is at rest, it only has the ones on the sides of its head open, which makes the others difficult to notice. If disturbed, however, the creature reveals its true nature by opening its additional eyes and unleashing their powers, despite the mental strain this causes.

The extra eye in its forehead is able to see the near future, allowing the creature to avoid incoming attacks before they're made. The other extra pair sees the different possibilities unraveling moment by moment, so that the chronoceros can choose the best way to attack its target and maximize damage.

A chronoceros is usually a quiet and peaceful herbivore creature, and thus it is more likely to run away rather than fight. However, during mating season or when a chronoceros' calves are threatened, they become increasingly aggressive.

Chronoceroses share the same habitat as ordinary rhinoceroses, and in fact, they can even be observed mingling together. It's unclear if their nonsapient cousins are aware of the difference between them or whether they simply treat chronoceroses as their own. Sometimes a chronoceros sensing danger intentionally incites a rhinoceros stampede to ensure its own escape.

The mental exertion that comes from using their extra eyes forces chronoceroses to be extremely careful as to when they choose to use their abilities, often opting instead to use their impressive size to scare off potential predators before a conflict begins. Only when conflict is inevitable will they resort to unleashing their full potential, despite the costs.

## Timely Intervention

The origin of chronoceroses is a subject of much debate. While some claim they are aberrations who lost their connection to their plane of origin, most think they were ordinary rhinoceroses changed by a god of time or prophecy. One legend states that hunters once drove rhinoceroses to the brink of extinction, and the god blessed some of them to defend the others. Another takes a dimmer view, claiming the original chronoceros accidentally stepped on a sacred animal of the god, bringing upon it the curse of painful foresight so that it could predict and avoid repeating the mistake.
