This adds 1d6 fire damage to the morphoid's melee unarmed attacks. Additionally, adjacent creatures that hit the morphoid with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch the morphoid or hit the morphoid with an unarmed attack take 1d6 fire damage.

    desc: "  A q-metal morphoid's ranged appendage Strike jettisons one of its limbs, removing that limb until it grows a new one. This deals the limbs normal damage plus 1d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target additionally takes 1d10 persistent fire damage."

  - name: "Grow Limb"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  A q-metal morphoid grows a new limb and determines which type of Strike the limb can make. This can be a large hammer-like fist, a long sharp spike, or a serrated tentacle. It can have no more than six attached limbs at any time, and it can only use a given Strike if it has at least one limb capable of making that Strike."

  - name: "Limb Whirlwind"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The q-metal morphoid spins around like a whirlwind of death, attacking nearby creatures with each of its current limbs. It can Strike once with each of its limb unarmed attacks, each against a different creature, to a maximum of six attacks if it has all six limbs. It applies its multiple attack penalty from these Strikes only after all the Strikes are complete."

Q-metal morphoids are metal elementals made of the strange and extremely rare special material known as q-metal, a silvery metal that bursts into flames when struck. Morphoids appear to somehow be both the avatars and creators of the metal at the same time; q-metal deposits are always found with a morphoid as a guardian, and the deposits grow as the morphoid extends their territory. This leads to an interesting chicken-and-egg question, though whichever came first, they seem to have originated from fallen meteoroids. Q-metal morphoids are able to create multiple appendages that detach from their bodies, and some enterprising individuals have attempted to taunt morphoids into throwing their appendages at them in order to collect the material and run away. This strategy is not recommended for anyone who doesn't desire a fiery death.

## Q Is For Questions

Q-metal has a number of potential applications, from more efficient smithing to flaming ammunition, but no research institution has obtained a large enough sample to perform a comprehensive analysis of its properties. Is the metal actually alive, and is there a hivemind that controls the morphoids? How do existing deposits expand without new meteoroids introducing more of the metal to the earth? Are the metal's properties magical or alchemical in nature? Unfortunately, only goblins have been reckless enough to obtain q-metal in any notable quantity, and they always end up wasting it to start forest fires.
