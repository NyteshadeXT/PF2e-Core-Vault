    desc: "  The iron houndmaster's two halves are not fully wired to function in unison. When the iron houndmaster rolls initiative, its hound half uses its normal initiative roll and its master half uses the result of its initiative roll â€“5. Neither half can Delay. Instead of getting three actions and one reaction as normal, each half of the iron houndmaster gains two actions and one reaction on its respective turn. The halves calculate their multiple attack bonus separately. Only the master can use the metal fist and shock stick Strikes, and only the hound can use the metallic fangs and dart gun Strikes."

  - name: "Release the Hound"
    desc: "  When the iron houndmaster is reduced to 60 or fewer Hit Points, its two halves separate. Its remaining Hit Points are split between the hound and the master, rounding up. While separated, the two halves gain 3 actions and a reaction on each of their turns, the hound's Speed increases to 50 feet, and both halves have their AC reduced to 24."

When a construct workshop ceased production of hound and guard type constructs and scrapped the remaining models, a rogue construct crafter found the scrap and tried to make them work again. The result was a batch of iron houndmasters, mismatched mechanical patrol units that excelled at locating and capturing any trespasser foolish enough to enter their patrol field.

## Separation Anxiety

Allowing an iron houndmaster to separate is a risky proposition because the halves may not combine back together correctly. When multiple houndmasters are on the field, the closest halves attempt to rewire themselves together at the end of combat. The result may be two masters or two hounds fused together, with a resulting duplication in their abilities.
