    desc: " (occult,visual) A creature within 30 feet who Seeks as a 1 minute activity (gazing carefully at the reflections upon the tahagata's body) can see a glimpse of their own fate. This acts similarly to a _Read Omens_ spell, but the predictions are made with one especially incorrect assumption. If the tahagata is aware of such observation, they can choose to purposefully twist the vision that the creature sees. In that case, the GM makes a secret DC 25 Will check save for the observer; on a failure, the tahagata shows them a false vision of the tahagata's design, often one that leads the observer to harm. A creature can only ever benefit from viewing any given tahagata's reflection a single time."

The creature must attempt a DC 21 Will check save; on a failure, while the tahagata remains Juxtaposed as them, the creature rolls twice and takes the lower result whenever it makes a check against the tahagata (this is a misfortune effect), while the tahagata rolls twice on checks it makes against the creature, taking the higher result (this is a fortune effect).\n[[Effects/Effect_ Juxtapose|Effect: Juxtapose]]"

Tahagatas are bizarre astral mirror entities that, due to their composition, are aware of the infinite variations of the other creatures around them that could have come to pass but ultimately did not—selves that could have existed had the creature made different decisions or had the random variations of the universe's forces been slightly different.

When a tahagata juxtaposes itself with another creature, mimicking that creature's form, it instinctively knows details of that creature's life, had they lived out their life as one of these other near-infinite variations. However, these details always diverge from reality in some way, sometimes subtly and at other times wildly. The knowledge of this incongruity wracks the tahagata's mind—only by removing the original creature from existence (which puts a final end to its continuously branching variations) can the tahagata lessen its anguish.

Mirrorborn are a family of creatures with connections to both the Astral Plane and the infinite alternate realities beyond the twisted dimensions found within mirrors. Much like the evil duplicates found on the other side of a _Darkside Mirror_, most mirrorborn represent the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, of things that aren't but could have been. This category of mirrorborn includes tahagatas and fragmentors, two entities formed from the paradoxical distortion of potential into a corporeal form. To a lesser extent, the same is true of chiraluses, the incarnations of the reflections that could never be, embodying reflections of creatures like vampires that ordinarily have no reflections. Finally, odrazu are highly unusual mirrorborn, as they form from a symbiotic hybrid between a devil and the Astral Plane, peppered with otherworldly energies from alternate mirror dimensions.

One commonality among all mirrorborn is their physical connection to mirrors: odrazu feed on reflections, chiraluses appear as two-dimensional reflections, tahagatas take a form built of myriad mirrored surfaces, and fragmentors are composed of countless jagged mirror shards. This doesn't mean that they are necessarily more likely to be found in areas where mirrors are more common, as each of the creatures brings their mirrored physicality along with them.

Despite being a family of creatures, mirrorborn rarely interact with each other. Even fragmentors, which can sometimes form out of a destroyed tahagata, rarely converse with tahagatas, and tahagatas for their part find the fragmented potential inherent to a fragmentor's essence distasteful and jarring, much like the sensation of wrongness they feel from an original creature after the tahagata juxtaposes with it.

## Tahagata Impersonators

Occasionally, a tahagata who destroyed the original version of the creature they juxtaposed attempts to continue impersonating that creature even after the juxtaposition ends. Without any magical ability to assist, they must do so purely through mundane disguises, and their fragmented memories of alternate timelines usually exposing them swiftly even if they can pull that part off.

## Through The Looking Glass

In addition to _darkside mirrors_, which send forth alternative versions of those reflected within, it's possible, though rare, to connect to realms beyond an ordinary mirror and encounter mirrorborn. The phenomenon is far more likely in places brimming with astral energies or in locations where the veil between the mortal world and the world beyond the mirror has been torn before, becoming thinner and thinner in the process. Those who enter through a mirror find that these mirror realms operate on their own bizarre rules, and while they eventually might re-emerge from another mirror, they often do so changed.

## Other Mirrorborn

The mirrorborn presented here are just the tip of the iceberg, as the possibilities in the infinite mirror universes are just as endless as the multiverse itself. Some rumors of other mirrorborn include:

*   **Darksiders**, creatures originating from a darkside mirror who have become permanent residents of this world, either seeking to bring more residents from their reality or to establish their own fiefdom in this one.
*   **Kryshards**, malevolent entities that form from the reflective shards of shattered crystal balls and use mirrors to spy on many other creatures and use the information for their own foul purposes.
*   **Mirror Mimes**, creatures who hide within mirrors and replace a creature's natural reflection in order to devour that creature's psyche, attempting to stay unnoticed by mimicking the creature's actions in front of mirrors.
*   **Reflectors**, creatures that position many mirrors across the battlefield when stalking their prey, shooting beams of light that bounce off the mirrors at unexpected angles and irradiate their victims.
