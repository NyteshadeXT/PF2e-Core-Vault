    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack,poison) **Requirements** The bell walker has a creature Grabbed\n**Effect** The bell walker's cap extends to an almost impossibly large size in order to cover the upper half of a grabbed creature. The bell walker attempts an Athletics check against the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. On a successful Athletics check, the bell walker successfully covers the creature's upper half. The creature is Slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes 2d10 + 6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its turns. The enveloped creature can get free by Escaping against DC 33, and it's automatically freed if it is no longer grabbed by the bell walker. The bell walker can't use its Toxic Fumes ability while it's using Noxious Kiss to cover a creature's upper half."

  - name: "Toxic Fumes"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (poison) The bell walker inflates its rubbery fungal cap and then expels a horrific toxic cloud that deals 11d6 poison damage in a 20-foot cone with a DC 29 Fortitude check save. The bell walker can't use Toxic Fumes again for 1d4 rounds as its toxic spores replenish."

The parasitic, aberrant fungal spores that make up a bell walker have a bizarre and predatory life cycle intent on propagation at any cost. First, the spores kill their hosts and infest their bodies, seizing control of their nervous system, musculature, and all major organs. Then, after the spores have taken full control of their victim's corpse, the various individual spores differentiate, undergoing various transformations as they specialize and become parts of a new being. And this being is the bell walker, clad in the tattered remnants of their host body. The parasitic spores consume the host's body fluids and organs and use them as fuel for their evolution. The parasites that devour the brain steal away all of the host's intelligence in order to command the parasites infesting the rest of the body. Meanwhile, the influence of the parasitic mold dries out the host's flesh and skin, hardening them almost to the point of petrification in order to protect the fungal aberration beneath from any harm, like a suit of grotesque armor.

The other spores continue to work on the remains to create the perfect vessel. The bones hollow out in order to house rubbery tendrils, threads, and parasitic organs, extending into two major tentacles that replace the body's arms. A bell-like cap bursts out from the neck cavity, expanding and contracting as if it were a giant mouth. Several additional small tendrils grow all over the bell walker's body.

While satisfied with almost any creature they can capture for food, bell walkers are particularly attracted to sources of occult magic. Unaware occultists and lesser aberrations might end up victims of the monster's curiosity.

## What A Fungi

Consuming a host's brain may transfer aspects of the original creature to the bell walker, such as mannerisms or posture. Rarely, it may even pick up the host's interests and phobias.
