    desc: " (aura,divine,mental,visual) 60 feet. An odrazu constantly surrounds itself in a cloak of absolute vanity and self-absorption. A non-devil creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 18 Will check save. If it fails, then as long as it remains in the aura, if it sees its reflection in a reflective surface within the aura's radius, it becomes [[undefined]] with its own reflection for 1 minute or until it can no longer see its reflection, whichever comes first. While fascinated, the creature can't willingly stop viewing its own reflection, or move such that it can no longer see its reflection. A creature that critically succeeds on their saving throw becomes temporarily immune to narcissistic compulsion for 1 hour."

  - name: "Taste Reflection"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Odrazu are capable of sipping away at a [[undefined]] creature's reflection, and they do so regularly, both because they adore the taste and to drain their victim's soul energy away and take it for themselves. The odrazu makes a tongue Strike against a fascinated creature who isn't doomed; the fascinated creature is [[undefined]] against this Strike. If the Strike hits and deals damage to the victim, the odrazu gains temporary Hit Points equal to twice the victim's level and a +2 status bonus to Charisma-based skill checks for 24 hours. The struck creature must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude check saving throw, becoming [[undefined]] on a failure or [[undefined]] on a critical failure. While the creature is doomed, it doesn't cast a reflection in any reflecting surface. This Strike doesn't otherwise end the fascinated condition on the creature even though fascination normally ends after a hostile action. However, if the creature was fascinated due to narcissistic compulsion, the lack of reflection means that the fascination automatically ends, as the creature can no longer see its own reflection. If the odrazu was unnoticed or undetected by the creature before Tasting its Reflection, it remains so after Tasting the creature's Reflection, even though a Strike would normally reveal its presence. While doomed by Taste Reflection, a creature can't observe the odrazu unless the odrazu takes another hostile action against the creature, rendering the odrazu effectively [[undefined]] to the creature.\n\n[[Effects/Effect_ Taste Reflection|Effect: Taste Reflection]]"

Also known as mirror devils, odrazu are the grotesque remnants of narcissistic creatures that, while they were still alive, made a foolish pact with a devil in order to further enhance their own charm. After their demise, these mortals were transformed into devils and infused with astral shards and fragments of mirror entities that make up creatures like fragmentors and tahagatas to form a bizarre type of hybrid being between a devil and an astral mirror creature. The patron devil's offers are often irresistible: incredible good looks, a silver tongue, or an undeniable force of personality. As payment for their bargain, the soul's infernal servitude sees them seeking out likewise egoistic mortalsâ€”easy marks for their progenitor to eventually exploit. In the intervening time, however, odrazus delight in inflicting small torments upon their victims.

A mortal's reflection is a gateway to a tiny fragment of their soul. Though far too meager a bounty for most devils to deign spending effort pursuing, fiends as wretched and vain as odrazu are all too eager to lap up such table scraps, delighting in the brief moment of restored glory that the reflection's energy affords them.

Creatures tormented by an odrazu often remain completely unaware of its presence, beyond experiencing a general, inexplicable feeling of malaise and hopelessness across all aspects of their lives. However, their obsessive behavior might start to seem suspicious to others as they stare longingly at their own reflection at interminable length. Then again, for an odrazu's most likely victims, such loathsome self-infatuation might not appear at all out of the ordinary.

Mirrorborn are a family of creatures with connections to both the Astral Plane and the infinite alternate realities beyond the twisted dimensions found within mirrors. Much like the evil duplicates found on the other side of a _[[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Darkside Mirror|Darkside Mirror]]_, most mirrorborn represent the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, of things that aren't but could have been. This category of mirrorborn includes tahagatas and fragmentors, two entities formed from the paradoxical distortion of potential into a corporeal form. To a lesser extent, the same is true of chiraluses, the incarnations of the reflections that could never be, embodying reflections of creatures like vampires that ordinarily have no reflections. Finally, odrazu are highly unusual mirrorborn, as they form from a symbiotic hybrid between a devil and the Astral Plane, peppered with otherworldly energies from alternate mirror dimensions.

One commonality among all mirrorborn is their physical connection to mirrors: odrazu feed on reflections, chiraluses appear as two-dimensional reflections, tahagatas take a form built of myriad mirrored surfaces, and fragmentors are composed of countless jagged mirror shards. This doesn't mean that they are necessarily more likely to be found in areas where mirrors are more common, as each of the creatures brings their mirrored physicality along with them.

Despite being a family of creatures, mirrorborn rarely interact with each other. Even fragmentors, which can sometimes form out of a destroyed tahagata, rarely converse with tahagatas, and tahagatas for their part find the fragmented potential inherent to a fragmentor's essence distasteful and jarring, much like the sensation of wrongness they feel from an original creature after the tahagata juxtaposes with it.

## The Wages Of Vanity

When odrazu bring vain souls to Hell and don't form them into new odrazus, the creatures are typically tortured amid halls of mirrors or reflecting pools that show off distorted versions of their visage, filling them with despair. These reflective surfaces connect to mirror dimensions, which also allow odrazu and their patrons to attempt to spread Hell's corruption into other realms.

## Through The Looking Glass

In addition to _darkside mirrors_, which send forth alternative versions of those reflected within, it's possible, though rare, to connect to realms beyond an ordinary mirror and encounter mirrorborn. The phenomenon is far more likely in places brimming with astral energies or in locations where the veil between the mortal world and the world beyond the mirror has been torn before, becoming thinner and thinner in the process. Those who enter through a mirror find that these mirror realms operate on their own bizarre rules, and while they eventually might re-emerge from another mirror, they often do so changed.

## Other Mirrorborn

The mirrorborn presented here are just the tip of the iceberg, as the possibilities in the infinite mirror universes are just as endless as the multiverse itself. Some rumors of other mirrorborn include:

*   **Darksiders**, creatures originating from a darkside mirror who have become permanent residents of this world, either seeking to bring more residents from their reality or to establish their own fiefdom in this one.
*   **Kryshards**, malevolent entities that form from the reflective shards of shattered crystal balls and use mirrors to spy on many other creatures and use the information for their own foul purposes.
*   **Mirror Mimes**, creatures who hide within mirrors and replace a creature's natural reflection in order to devour that creature's psyche, attempting to stay unnoticed by mimicking the creature's actions in front of mirrors.
*   **Reflectors**, creatures that position many mirrors across the battlefield when stalking their prey, shooting beams of light that bounce off the mirrors at unexpected angles and irradiate their victims.
