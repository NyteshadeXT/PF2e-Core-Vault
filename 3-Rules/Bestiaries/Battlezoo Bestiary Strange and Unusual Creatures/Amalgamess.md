  - name: "Banishment Restoration"
    desc: "  _Banishment_ can end an amalgamess's tragic state. Despite its willingness to have the spell cast on it, due to its dual wills, the amalgamess instinctively tries to resist being banished. If the banishment is successful, the original summoner is returned to normal, albeit with the possibility of some lingering eccentricities. If the spell fails, however, the attempt is likely to enrage the amalgamess and throw it into a violent frenzy."

The amalgamess Casts a Spell and makes a claw Strike against a creature within its reach other than the target of the spell. If the spell has an attack roll, both attacks count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after it's made both of them. The amalgamess can't use Somatic Flailing again until it uses Writhing Crawl."

Formed when a practitioner of magic has enough knowledge to summon a fiend but not enough experience to know how to do so correctly, an amalgamess is the result of a summoning ritual gone wrong. Due to the failed ritual, the creature being summoned was accidentally called within the summoner's body, causing both to become unnaturally fused together in a way similar to how an amalgamite can be formed due to a teleportation mishap.

While the physical fusion of an amalgamess is fully permanent and very difficult to reverse, the minds of the two entities remain partially separated. The amalgamess functions as one creature, but the fragments of the two minds each have their own agenda. The mind of the summoner desperately seeks to survive long enough to someday discover a way to undo the horror that befell it, while the mind of the summoned fiend seeks to end its agonizing existence on the Material Plane so that it can return to its home plane at the cost of the summoner's life.

Reasoning with an amalgamess is nigh impossible due to its fractured minds, but an offer to cast the banishment spell on it is enough to draw its attention, as it's one of the few ways to end its tragic condition.

## Bad Luck Banishment

Summoning rituals aren't the only spells that can go wrong—banishment can wreak havoc too. The longer the amalgamess's fusion lasts, the more the essences of the two creatures intermingle. However, if an amalgamess has existed for more than a year and critically succeeds its Will save against banishment, the two creatures can rarely be restored to their original states. However, if they critically fail their save, the result can instead be a horrific mix of body parts, known as a greater amalgamess. This tragic condition can be somewhat fixed by them becoming an amalgamess again and hoping the next banishment goes better. Or, in extremely rare cases, much worse.
