    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The contortion swarm is Inhabiting a cluster of objects\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The swarm pummels each enemy in its space with the multitude of junk they use as carapaces, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage with a DC 20 Reflex check save."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The contortion swarm isn't currently Inhabiting objects\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Each individual juvenile contortion creeper in the contortion swarm crawls inside an adjacent unattended Tiny object with Hardness 5 or less, such as a metal can, a small bag, or similar container. The containers become extradimensional spaces with an interior large enough for the juvenile creepers to fit inside, regardless of the object's exterior volume. While Inhabiting an object, the contortion swarm gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and loses its weaknesses to area and splash damage. The inhabited objects for the swarm as a whole have their Hardness increase to 5, and their Hit Points and Break Threshold respectively increase to 20 and 10 via the contortion swarm's extradimensional magic; after taking enough damage to break, or if the contortion swarm takes 5 or more area damage or splash damage, their dwellings are destroyed until the swarm Inhabits new ones. When not Inhabiting objects, the contortion swarm can't use its Carapace Pummels or Retract abilities."

The contortion swarm attempts Thievery checks to [[undefined]] from up to two creatures occupying their space. Unlike normal for Stealing, they can attempt to Steal from these two creatures even if those creatures are in combat or are otherwise on their guard."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The contortion swarm Inhabits an object\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The contortion swarm's constituent members fully withdraw into their improvised carapaces. Their circumstance bonus to AC increases to +4, and they can't take actions except to use this action again to come out of their carapaces."

A contortion swarm consists of a small colony of young contortion creepers. These creepers inhabit piles and clusters of litter and discarded junk. Once a young contortion creeper becomes too large for their carapace, they leave the colony to strike out on their own.

* * *

Contortions are a family of aberrations that share a distinctive behavior: like hermit crabs, they find and inhabit discarded objects, which they use as dwellings to protect their vulnerable bodies from harm. However, unlike hermit crabs, contortions tend to inhabit junk found in humanoid settlements rather than shells on the beach. Like hermit crabs, contortions continue to grow and trade up to larger and larger dwellings. While the smallest might live in a shoe, the largest are big enough to inhabit small buildings.

## Contortion Colonies

When a mature contortion creeper or contortion crown comes across a large enough quantity of junk, the glee from this new treasure trove causes polyps to swell up around the base of their arms. Eventually, these polyps explode, releasing a small colony of infant contortions. The members of the colony inhabit the smaller pieces of junk until they grow enough to form a contortion swarm.
