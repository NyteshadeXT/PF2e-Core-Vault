Living creatures who begin their turn inside the congealed laughter's distracting aura must succeed at a DC 33 Will check saving throw. On a failure, the creature is afflicted with fits of giggles. Until the end of their turn, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 Flat check to perform any activity with the manipulate trait, as well as any spell with a verbal component.

One congealed laughter is in the same space as the original, and the other is in an adjacent, unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, the new congealed laughter automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy for the new congealed laughter to push)."

Most trickster gods have many faces, and usually at least one of those faces is malicious. A trickster god's malice embodies schadenfreude at the suffering of others and laughs at displays of depravity and cruelty. This cruel laughter echoes across the darkness between the stars and in the minds of those who follow their more wicked urges. Sometimes, this laughter reaches strange magical anomalies in the void, and the two conjoin and congeal into a thick, mindless substance that seeks out souls to devour so that it may grow and spread its heinous mockery across the universe.

Congealed laughter is an ectoplasmic mass that resembles a dark storm cloud roiling with countless vile mouths that cackle discordantly, pulsing with bright veins of some strange extraplanar energy, floating through the planes in search of souls to devour.

Trickster echoes are fragments left behind due to the actions of a powerful trickster deity, drifting throughout the universe in the wake of the trickster's mischief. Tricksters are a popular archetype among the many different deities across the world's various pantheons and cultures. Traditionally, trickster deities take many forms, using their disguises and deceptions to bewilder, confuse, and mislead all those around them. Why trickster deities continually deceive all those around them varies from trickster to trickster. Some tricksters are compulsive liars. Others have an agenda they seek to pursue or simply find the idea of successfully pulling off pranks exhilarating or hilarious. Still other tricksters flit between moral codes, attempting to join with heroic deities for a time, only to inevitably betray their allies, or even their siblings, in a series of countless shifting adjustments of allegiance.

Disguises are a big part of the reason mortals and other deities alike can't help but continue engaging with trickster deities, as they might never come to realize exactly with whom they are dealing or only discover that the mysterious figure offering advice was a trickster after it was too late. However, deception alone isn't sufficient. Tricksters tend to be legitimately multi-talented in a variety of different skills, with incredible talent and unparalleled techniques. Thus, before their sudden but inevitable betrayal, a trickster is a superlative ally, capable of achieving all sorts of impossible feats on behalf of their allies, deific or otherwise.

When trickster deities perform an especially notable prank, betrayal, or other act of mischief, they might leave behind a powerful echo, known as a trickster echo. Depending on the trickster's actions and physicality, various sorts of trickster echoes congeal or coagulate. For instance, a trickster's skills and clever nature can give rise to a meddling hands, while a trickster's lies, alongside its deceptive tongue and facial features, lead to the birth of a many faces. A thousand skins slough off when a trickster changes guises between various forms in order to mislead all around them or ruin another's reputation. Meanwhile, the mindless malice of a trickster deity's laughter births a congealed laughter.

## Mindless Laughter

Congealed laughter doesn't have a mind of its own. It merely embodies the eldritch and otherworldly sense of humor of a trickster deity. Some might find it strange that a creature composed of a complex mental and emotional phenomenon such as laughter can fulfill its purpose without a mind, but congealed laughter proves with deadly certainty just how possible such a thing could be.

## Trickster's Trail

Adventurers who find themselves at odds with a trickster, chasing after the deity's trail of plots and schemes, often find their path obstructed by a variety of foes thrown in their way by the trickster deity themselves. Chief among these opponents are the trickster echoes, whether they arise naturally and inadvertently through the trickster's actions or the trickster intentionally creates them in order to oppose those who threaten to catch them in the act.

This could lead to an entire adventure or campaign: First, the adventurers challenge the meddling hands setting up the trickster's schemes. Then come across a congealed laughter while the trickster chortles with glee as their plans near completion. As the adventurers begin to unravel the trickster's lies, they come face to face (or perhaps face to faces?) with a many faces. Before they have grown strong enough to challenge the trickster directly, the trickster sends a thousand skins to finish them off. Finally, the adventurers confront the trickster to solve this cosmic jest once and for all.
