Each creature in a 60-foot emanation must attempt a DC 19 Will check save. Regardless of the result, creatures are temporarily immune for 1 minute. Other owlpacas automatically get a critical success, and if another ally rolls worse than a success, they get a success instead.\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n**Success** The creature is Frightened 1.\n**Failure** The creature is Frightened 2.\n**Critical Failure** The creature is Frightened 3 and Fleeing for 1 round."

If the creature also has persistent bleed damage from Eye Peck, it's Blinded until it either removes the bleed damage or the sickened condition."

This amalgamation of an owl and an alpaca came about after an eccentric magical shepherd performed bizarre experiments to keep their herd safe from local goblins who kept killing the previous guard dogs. After seeing the effectiveness of the new animal in protecting the shepherd's flock, other herders in the area started requesting owlpacas as well, and they've begun to spread from there.

Much like alpacas, owlpacas make excellent guards for their herds. For this reason, it isn't unheard of for adventurers to occasionally bring one along if no one in the party has the ability to see in dim light. Much like owls, an owlpaca's eyes are fixed in place, so they have to turn their heads in order to change their view. With a longer neck, owlpacas are able to rotate their necks even further than an owl, to a maximum of 270 degrees in their youth, without tearing any tendons. If more than one owlpaca is watching over a herd, the two with the longest necks flank the rest to give the most coverage.

While an owlpaca's wool-like fiber isn't as soft as that of other herd animals, there are some herders whose herds now consist entirely of owlpacas. Owlpacas need to be sheared every two years, but the shearer must be careful to avoid the feathers in the process or the owlpaca might attack them. What makes this more difficult is that each owlpaca has a non-standardized pattern of feather growth. Neglectful owners often let the wool around the feathers get matted rather than risk shearing nearby.

Alpacas and other camelids are unable to crossbreed with owlpacas. Researchers have wisely avoided ridicule by not experimenting to see if that is true of owlpacas and owls.

## Hoots For Dinner

The owlpaca is an omnivore that prefers a mix of grasses and rodents. Like regular alpacas, its spit consists of partially digested meals from its stomach. An owlpaca that recently ate may add bludgeoning damage or the sickened condition to its spit depending on what comprised its meal. A partially digested mouse to the face gives most predators cause to turn away.

## When Owlpacas Fly

Some owlpacas are born with wings. Flight does not come naturally to them, but these rare mutants manage a fly speed of 10 feet when they reach maturity. While this makes them slightly more powerful, since they don't have a damaging ranged option, this adjustment isn't enough to noticeably increase the owlpaca's overall capabilities.
