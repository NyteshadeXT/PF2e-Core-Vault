A kayman bacoo is immune to alcohol addiction but treats every Fortitude saving throw against alcohol as one degree of success worse than they rolled. While suffering from the effects of alcohol, a kayman bacoo gains the Slowed condition with a value equal to the alcohol's poison stage. If a kayman bacoo's slowed condition equals or exceeds 3, they fall Unconscious for 2d4 hours. A kayman bacoo is inclined to drink any alcohol they are offered."

On the flooded coasts of the fey realm, the roots of fey mangrove forests reach deep to entangle the roots of Material Plane counterparts. Long ago, fey called bacoos climbed the roots into the Material Plane to see how mortals behaved. When they witnessed the callousness and brutality of the Material Plane, bacoos decided the people must have been put here as a cruel joke. Some, who called themselves kayman bacoos, found the most humor in the sweet lies of rum.

Kayman bacoos are small crocodilian fey characterized by wild tempers and prickly senses of humor. To kayman bacoos, offerings of rum, sweets, or flesh are the only reasons to grant the local humans any peace. They love rum despite their low tolerance for drink and refuse to restrain their appetites.

By day, they lounge in the trees bordering small villages or other human settlements, often nursing hangovers. But by night, kayman bacoos stalk the eaves, looking for partygoers or merrymakers who might be drinking rum without offering them a sip first. When they smell rum on someone's breath, they silently fall into line behind them and attempt to follow them home. If noticed, they ask their prey some variation of "Out for a drink? Did you leave me any?"

Those who live in an area haunted by kayman bacoos know better than to go carousing or host a party without leaving an offering of rum on their doorstep. Wise locals can then answer truthfully that they have left rum out for the fey. Anyone caught unprepared must make a choice: either invite the kayman bacoos in for a drink or suffer their wrath. Kayman bacoos quickly succumb to the sedative effects of alcohol, but their idea of what constitutes a party typically involves scatological pranks and profound overapplication of rowdy magic.

Most communities tolerate their local kayman bacoos because they exterminate rats and other pests. Even if they don't appreciate their scaly neighbors, driving off these gluttonous fey usually proves beyond the means of the local authorities.

## Bacoo Characters
