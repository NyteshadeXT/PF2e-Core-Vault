Attempts to overthrow the thrones of demon lords are a regular occurrence in the Abyss, a baleful realm driven by destruction, power, hate, and greed. Most of these would-be usurpers are easily dispatched, after which both the pretender and their cohorts tend to be punished harshly as an example for other demons to discourage further rebellion.

A humiliating destination for arson demons or other demons who love violence is to trap their souls inside the body of one of the most harmless creatures, a sheep.

If the sheep lives long enough, the soul of the demon eventually has enough time to find small cracks in its confinement, allowing the demon's sapience to partly re-emerge. When this happens, the sheep, now driven by an insatiable thirst for destruction, is irretrievably changed, giving birth to a lucent demonsheep.

Even as a lucent demonsheep's behavior changes with the demon's emergence, slowly but surely becoming more cunning and dangerous, their appearance does not. It is only in these brief moments of clarity that the demon's soul is able to fully emerge and twist the body of its host into a strange mix of sheep and demon.

## Baaaad Romance

Lucent demonsheep are dangerous enough on their own, but they are nigh unstoppable when led by a demon shepherd. The slightest hint of their existence can lead to cullings of entire herds to prevent those more dangerous demons from emerging.

## Black Sheep

Has anyone considered that sheep are not as innocent as they appear? Perhaps there is a bleakness to the lives of farm animals that encourages demonic influences in even the meekest of creatures. Possessed cows, demon sheep, corrupted chickensâ€¦ meanwhile, capybaras are famed for their relaxed nature, and no one has ever heard of a demonic capybara.
