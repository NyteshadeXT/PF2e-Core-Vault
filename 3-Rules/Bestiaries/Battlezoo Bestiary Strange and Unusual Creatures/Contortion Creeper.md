A contortion creeper is a skittish aberration that protects its fragile, deformed body by hiding inside ordinary objects smaller than itself. The creature seldom reveals itself, often displaying only a pair of beady yellow eyes and a deformed arm protruding from a disproportionately small container such as a stein or water skin.

Each contortion creeper possesses a personal extradimensional space accessed by creating a portal from the openings of existing objects. A creeper inhabits such an object by deforming its anatomy to fit inside the narrow opening.

Using the item as an improvised carapace, the creeper scurries through urban environments, hiding in plain sight among garbage in the streets or junk littering dwellings. Though capable of defending themselves, most creepers avoid violence and prefer to flee or hide from threats. Naturally curious, contortion creepers enjoy collecting intriguing items such as dining utensils, tools, and broken clockwork to ponder their use and function. Such items fill a creeper's personal extradimensional space, where the aberration prizes its unseen collection. A creeper can be persuaded to trade or provide information in exchange for items that fascinate the creature.

* * *

Contortions are a family of aberrations that share a distinctive behavior: like hermit crabs, they find and inhabit discarded objects, which they use as dwellings to protect their vulnerable bodies from harm. However, unlike hermit crabs, contortions tend to inhabit junk found in humanoid settlements rather than shells on the beach. Like hermit crabs, contortions continue to grow and trade up to larger and larger dwellings. While the smallest might live in a shoe, the largest are big enough to inhabit small buildings.

## Contortion Colonies

When a mature contortion creeper or contortion crown comes across a large enough quantity of junk, the glee from this new treasure trove causes polyps to swell up around the base of their arms. Eventually, these polyps explode, releasing a small colony of infant contortions. The members of the colony inhabit the smaller pieces of junk until they grow enough to form a contortion swarm.

## Creeper Collections

A contortion creeper's collection and extradimensional nest become inaccessible if its improvised carapace breaks or is destroyed. When a contortion creeper is slain, its collection spills out into the Material Plane and appears beside its corpse.
