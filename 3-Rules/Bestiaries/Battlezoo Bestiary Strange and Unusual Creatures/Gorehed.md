Goreheds are a conglomeration of humanoid and frog, with a head that resembles that of a humanoid with one eye, a large maw of serrated teeth to better tear flesh, and a wrinkled, compact body like a frog with large webbed hands and clawed feet. While capable of bipedal travel, for more support, goreheds travel on all fours. Goreheds love humanoid flesh, and they use their mimicking voices to lure prey into their lairs. Goreheds make their lairs in swampy regions, where they can drown their prey and infect them with their young. Gorehed lairs modify the natural environment, sometimes causing a nuisance for those in the area. These lairs are made of mud, stone, and trees and built to withstand the elements.

Goreheds are intelligent but don't seem to use any crafted tools or weapons, preferring to rely on their natural abilities instead. Any fabric or items goreheds retain are from prey, not crafted by the goreheds themselves. Goreheds instinctually tend to distrust and fear magic. Once they notice a spellcaster, goreheds usually retreat unless they outnumber their potential prey. Goreheds typically hunt in packs of four or more to make sure they have the advantage over a single target, and they sometimes employ as many as ten adults in a hunting party when going after large prey.

Goreheds usually hunt to eat and breed, but even when they are already well- fed, they enjoy luring prey to their deaths just for fun. No one is sure of the origin of these bizarre creatures. Rumors say they came from an opening in the sky, but nothing has been found to prove this.

## Hold Your Tongue

Goreheds have an inflated sense of self- worth. They boast to each other about the size of their heads, the height of their leaps, the precision of their imitations... pretty much every aspect of themselves, which makes their one inferiority complex stand out even more: goreheds are jealous of frog tongues. Stuck with the pathetic, stubby tongues of humanoids, goreheads envy frogs for how far their tongues reach. That is why they cut tongues from their victims, not for display as trophies but to tie to the ends of their own tongues in hopes that they will somehow merge into an extended organ.
