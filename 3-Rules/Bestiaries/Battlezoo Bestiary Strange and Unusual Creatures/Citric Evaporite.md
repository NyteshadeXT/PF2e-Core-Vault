    desc: "  When the citric evaporite is in its molten form and is hit by at least 5 gallons of water, the water hitting the superheated molten citrate immediately evaporates into a cloud of steam enveloping the area. This obscures the area in a 30-foot emanation for 1d4 rounds, with the effects of obscuring mist, and the citric evaporite condenses into its crystal form. All creatures except the citric evaporite within the emanation takes 12d6 fire damage (DC 27 Reflex check save)."

Everyone in the area takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and 8d6 fire damage (DC 27 Reflex check save). After a Body Splash, the citric evaporite splashes all over the ground and must use Reform before performing any other actions. It can't use Body Splash again until the next time it enters molten form."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The citric evaporite reforms its body into a cohesive structure and is able to act again. After using Body Splash or leaving an area of lava, the citric evaporite melts to the point that it must Reform itself before acting."

Citric evaporites, also known as crystal oozes or lava oozes, can be found in two locations: deep underground, near certain volcanic flows, or near salt-rich seasonal lakes. Those found near the lakes are typically more sluggish and can easily be dispersed by aqueous deluges. Those found underground can easily slip into lava, becoming nearly invisible before erupting out at terrifying speeds towards unsuspecting prey.

Citric evaporites exist in two forms: their salt citrate crystalline form, which is slow-moving, reasonably docile, and slowly consumes nearby citrate formations; and their molten form, which is fast, unpredictable, and prone to aggressive destruction. The molten form seeks out nearby heat sources, including warm- blooded creatures, to maintain its heat capacity.

When a citric evaporite attacks, on first inspection, victims see a well-formed but slightly cloudy crystal formation. Small bits of the crystal can be ground, creating a powdery salt that might work well for baking. But those who venture that close are quickly disillusioned as the crystal reaches out to wrap around them.

Small samples of the citric salt harvested from a citric evaporite are extremely useful in storing magical and thermal energy, though extreme care must be taken near water sources.

## Don't Be Salty

The nature of the citric evaporite's attacks leaves a layer of salt covering its victims. This residue is insufficient to constitute its own creature, though it can cause the corpse to continue moving in eerie ways until it cools down. Finding these bodies is the safest way of harvesting citric salt, which is why those in that lucrative trade are always unfailingly polite and offer to let others go ahead of them.
