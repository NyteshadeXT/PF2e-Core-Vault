    desc: "`pf2:r` (concentrate,illusion,occult,visual) **Requirements** The fragmentor has at least one phantasm manifested\n\n**Trigger** The fragmentor would be hit by an attack.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The fragmentor calls one of its existing phantasms, which instantly appears in a square adjacent to the fragmentor, and interposes itself in the path of the attack. The source of the attack must attempt a DC 11 Flat check; on a failure, the phantasm is destroyed, and the fragmentor changes the result of the attack from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure."

  - name: "Visionsense (Imprecise) 120 feet"
    desc: "  The fragmentor can sense any and all creatures who possess a visual sense that are within 120 feet of it. Creatures whose visual senses are suppressed (or who aren't processing much visual information, such as if they are closing their eyes) can't be detected using visionsense."

  - name: "Distorting Edges"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) The fragmentor's countless shards warp and distort, spinning through the fragmentor's space with razor sharp edges. Each foe in the fragmentor's space takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 25 Reflex check save)."

  - name: "Phantasms"
    desc: " (illusion,occult,visual) **Trigger** The fragmentor uses Distorting Edges and at least one creature fails its save\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The fragmentor creates a phantasm (two phantasms if the triggering creature critically failed) in an unoccupied square within 10 feet. Phantasms are Medium, quasi-real illusions, which resemble the form of the triggering creature (changing size such that they are Medium, even if the triggering creature isn't). Phantasms act independently of the fragmentor, taking their turns either immediately before or after the fragmentor. Phantasms have 2 actions each turn that they can use only to Fly. Phantasms have a fly speed of 30 feet, and their saving throw modifiers and AC are equal to the fragmentor's. Phantasms are substantial enough to provide flanking, and other creatures cannot pass through their space. A phantasm disappears if it is hit by an attack or fails a save, after 1 minute passes, if the fragmentor or the creature it was created from dies or gains the dying condition, or if it is ever further than 100 feet away from the fragmentor. A typical fragmentor can only have at most seven phantasms at a time, but more powerful fragmentors might exist that can have more phantasms."

  - name: "Shatter Phantasm"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (illusion,occult) The fragmentor destroys one of its phantasms, creating a 10-foot burst centered at any point in the phantasm's space, which deals 3d6 piercing damage (DC 25 Reflex check save). The fragmentor chooses one of the following additional effects:\n\n*   The fragmentor teleports to the space previously occupied by the phantasm. This additional effect has the conjuration and teleportation traits.\n*   The fragmentor gains 10 temporary Hit Points as the shattered phantasm's fragments coalesce into its own form.\n*   Each creature that failed their saving throw against Shatter Phantasm is also [[undefined]] for 1 round ([[undefined]] for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure). Shatter Phantasm gains the visual trait."

Fragmentors are the remnants of those who have been confronted with alternate versions of themselves—from other dimensions, split timelines, or malicious curses—and, in the process, had their sense of self ruptured, leaving behind only thousands of formless slivers of themselves. These slivers are drawn to other sapient creatures, often creating simulacra of the creatures in a desperate bid to regain some of the sense of self that they have irrevocably lost. While fragmentors retain memories of their past lives, they are often inextricably tangled with memories of their alternate selves, which makes communication difficult at best and mindwarping at worst.

Fragmentors are also sometimes created as a byproduct when a particularly tenacious tahagata is destroyed.

Mirrorborn are a family of creatures with connections to both the Astral Plane and the infinite alternate realities beyond the twisted dimensions found within mirrors. Much like the evil duplicates found on the other side of a _[[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Darkside Mirror|Darkside Mirror]]_, most mirrorborn represent the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, of things that aren't but could have been. This category of mirrorborn includes tahagatas and fragmentors, two entities formed from the paradoxical distortion of potential into a corporeal form. To a lesser extent, the same is true of chiraluses, the incarnations of the reflections that could never be, embodying reflections of creatures like vampires that ordinarily have no reflections. Finally, odrazu are highly unusual mirrorborn, as they form from a symbiotic hybrid between a devil and the Astral Plane, peppered with otherworldly energies from alternate mirror dimensions.

One commonality among all mirrorborn is their physical connection to mirrors: odrazu feed on reflections, chiraluses appear as two-dimensional reflections, tahagatas take a form built of myriad mirrored surfaces, and fragmentors are composed of countless jagged mirror shards. This doesn't mean that they are necessarily more likely to be found in areas where mirrors are more common, as each of the creatures brings their mirrored physicality along with them.

Despite being a family of creatures, mirrorborn rarely interact with each other. Even fragmentors, which can sometimes form out of a destroyed tahagata, rarely converse with tahagatas, and tahagatas for their part find the fragmented potential inherent to a fragmentor's essence distasteful and jarring, much like the sensation of wrongness they feel from an original creature after the tahagata juxtaposes with it.

## Fragmentor Insight

While it's exceptionally difficult to commu- nicate with fragmentors and even harder to parse what they're saying, fragmentors possess a rare insight into what is, what was, and what could have been due to their jumbled memories, some of which come from alternate versions of themselves. Those who wonder about the path not taken could do worse than to consult a fragmentor.

## Through The Looking Glass

In addition to _darkside mirrors_, which send forth alternative versions of those reflected within, it's possible, though rare, to connect to realms beyond an ordinary mirror and encounter mirrorborn. The phenomenon is far more likely in places brimming with astral energies or in locations where the veil between the mortal world and the world beyond the mirror has been torn before, becoming thinner and thinner in the process. Those who enter through a mirror find that these mirror realms operate on their own bizarre rules, and while they eventually might re-emerge from another mirror, they often do so changed.

## Other Mirrorborn

The mirrorborn presented here are just the tip of the iceberg, as the possibilities in the infinite mirror universes are just as endless as the multiverse itself. Some rumors of other mirrorborn include:

*   **Darksiders**, creatures originating from a darkside mirror who have become permanent residents of this world, either seeking to bring more residents from their reality or to establish their own fiefdom in this one.
*   **Kryshards**, malevolent entities that form from the reflective shards of shattered crystal balls and use mirrors to spy on many other creatures and use the information for their own foul purposes.
*   **Mirror Mimes**, creatures who hide within mirrors and replace a creature's natural reflection in order to devour that creature's psyche, attempting to stay unnoticed by mimicking the creature's actions in front of mirrors.
*   **Reflectors**, creatures that position many mirrors across the battlefield when stalking their prey, shooting beams of light that bounce off the mirrors at unexpected angles and irradiate their victims.
