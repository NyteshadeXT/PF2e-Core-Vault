Xotlxotl are hybrids of salamanders, toads, catfish, and roughly humanoid forms, created by more powerful aberrations long ago. They seek to emulate their creators by warping reality around themselves, forcing mutations upon their own flesh, and disappearing as foes approach.

Variations in individual appearance are great, but xotlxotl all share some similar features. Standing fully upright, they reach around five feet tall, but their hunched posture makes them closer to four feet instead. External gill stalks around their scalps and barbels on their faces vary greatly in number and size between individuals. Their smooth skin is vibrant and riotous, typically with a main coloration of black, white, or pink but with starkly contrasting spots or stripes. It's the combination of large, unblinking black eyes and a mouth that always seems to be smiling that is most endearing to some and off-putting to others.

Fortunately, xotlxotl seem to have little interest in conflict with others. Travelers have reported being met with a cold and reserved attitude, but not hostility. They do, however, engage in a form of casual cruelty toward their own kind, or at least that's how those who don't know their ways would perceive it.

To xotlxotl, bullying and abuse are normal. They know that in life only the strongest and fittest survive, and they push the ones they care about most to be the toughest and best they can be. Xotlxotl even expose their own clutches of eggs to poisons and alchemical wastes to weed out the weakest specimens before hatching. They prefer to keep strangers weak, and so they typically avoid conflict when possible unless they plan to finish their foes off. This makes developing friendships and diplomatic relations with xotlxotl a double-edged sword at best, since increasing closeness or intimacy leads to increased bullying.

Though mutation is common among xotlxotl, most of these differences are cosmetic, but three bear special mention. The xotlxotl presented here has a sudden mutation based on a lesser juggernaut mutagen, but others might have mutations based on other lesser mutagens instead. Some choose to undergo an irreversible alchemical procedure that forces them to develop into a stronger, larger form but loses their aquatic prowess in the process. A small percentage of xotlxotl who live to old age experience a strange transformation. Rather than succumbing to frailty with age, they begin to grow and twist into stranger and more powerful forms, more akin to their elder god progenitors.

## Xotlxotl Characters

Xotlxotl who become interested in the outside world as a vector to explore their mutations can be strong allies, though they might put their companions through merciless challenges as a form of training and self-improvement.
