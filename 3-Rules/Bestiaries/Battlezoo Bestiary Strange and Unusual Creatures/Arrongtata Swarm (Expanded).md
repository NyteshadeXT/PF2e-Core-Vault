An arrongtata swarm is a cohesive and loyal battalion of approximately 400 arrongtata. The battalion works like a hive mind due to arrongtata's telepathic connection and rigorous military training. Arrongtata swarms are often commanded by an arrongtata commander.

Arrongtata are tiny, bipedal spirits with stubby, pointed tails that hold their detached faces as shields. These faces contain two round, unblinking eyes that glow on command and can be used in unison to flash brightly to weaken their enemies. The faces cover the entirety of their blocky bodies, and there is a telepathic connection between the spirit and its shield face.

Arrongtata are hostile to any creature they believe are likely to harm nature. These spirits are militaristic, constantly honing their skills in warfare. They form battalions, and the bonds between each arrongtata in the battalion allow them to effortlessly align and rearrange their shield faces and spears to skillfully attack their enemies. Sometimes, an arrongtata in a swarm will go an entire battle without ever holding their own shield face.

* * *

Arrongtata were once kami who forsook their wards to seek out trespassers on sacred grounds. Abandoning their duty as kami allowed them to roam freely, but while they weren't punished nearly as harshly as oni, their choice still cost them their vision and most of their magical powers. To overcome this, arrongtata bound their bodies to a shield face that they crafted from natural materials. Arrongtata are hostile to any creature they believe will harm nature, though they get along surprisingly well with non-evil oni, as the two can empathize with each other's pasts, their choices, and the overly harsh punishments they've received. If their shield face is destroyed, they can craft a new one in a week, and it is sturdy enough to be used as shield material by those who manage to defeat them.

## Reading Faces

The material an arrongtata uses to craft a shield face carries personal significance. Most choose a material matching what they defended as kami, though others select something they wish to protect in their new roles. Front-line fighters often have faces made of hardy wood or metal for better protection. Strategists have rock faces that channel the wisdom of the earth, while grass or fur faces help scouts blend into their environments. But the most fearsome arrongtata are those with bone faces—they are spirits of vengeance with nothing left to lose, for all they sought to defend has died.
