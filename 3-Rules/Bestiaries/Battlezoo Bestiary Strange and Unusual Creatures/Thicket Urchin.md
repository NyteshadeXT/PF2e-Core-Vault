The hills have teeth. At rest, a thicket urchin resembles a hill covered in short, evergreen shrubbery. When it hunts, however, it reveals its true form as an enormous fungal creature with a hard but porous shell. Bristling green spines extend from its shell, like those of its namesake, the mundane sea urchin. A thicket urchin's formidable armored shell has only one weak point: the soft underbelly, which is hard to reach but can be tipped over, leaving the creature helpless until it can right itself.

The spines of a thicket urchin are coated with a powerful hallucinogenic poison that can be distilled into a potent drug for spiritual or recreational uses, but the thicket urchin is too powerful for most to safely hunt. Instead, drug peddlers scavenge spent harpoons and needles in the wake of its passing, and locals give any new hills a wide berth.

## Thick As Thieves

Thicket urchins are so large that there is space between their spines for small creatures to hide in them, provided they can deal with accidental scratches and the resulting poison. They are a natural fit for pukwudgies, who delight in driving thicket urchins toward villages that they perceive as having slighted them. Should the thicket urchin fail to cause enough destruction, an entire band of pukwudgies may leap out to finish the job.
