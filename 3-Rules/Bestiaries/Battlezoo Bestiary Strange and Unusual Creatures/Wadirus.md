  - name: "Swarm Rejuvenation"
    desc: "  A wadirus's swarm is part of its true self. After defeating a wadirus, its swarm disperses, and 2d4 days later, one of the constituent creatures grows into a new wadirus if even a single one escapes. While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the wadirus's foes have to dispatch the [[undefined]] creatures before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the wadirus collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 Flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the creatures escapes, and the wadirus is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the wadirus."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The wadirus fills a 5-foot burst within 25 feet with its frog swarm. The frogs do no damage, but all creatures within this area when the wadirus moves it or at the start of their turn are exposed to wadirus poison. Once per turn, the wadirus can move the burst up to 25 feet or dissipate it with a single action, which has the concentrate trait. If the wadirus's frog swarm is ever more than 100 feet from the wadirus, it automatically dissipates. Once the frog swarm dissipates, the wadirus must use this action to send the swarm forth again. If it uses Frog Swarm before the swarm has dissipated, doing so dissipates the existing swarm before sending it forth once again."

Some people in urban areas view jungles as pristine wildlands that are good for nothing but pillaging resources for their own purposes. Those who would dare attempt to exploit jungle lands risk running afoul of many dangerous creatures, but none are so dedicated to protecting their arboreal homes as the froglike fey guardians known as wadiruses.

A wadirus has the appearance of a giant tree frog with black and bright blue, green, or yellow markings all over its body. Its entire spine is covered by a crest of large, multicolored, iridescent feathers. These quills aren't just present for decoration, however, and a wadirus can use its tongue to pluck one of its quills off its spine and flick it as a dart with surprising range. Though wadiruses have opposable thumbs, their legs aren't particularly well-suited for bipedal movement, and therefore they rarely stand upright or use weapons or tools.

Iruses are a family of fey creatures who find beauty in remote places most humanoids and other mortal folk overlook. Unfortunately for those who pass through their domains, they assume anyone in their territory is there to despoil it and react violently.

Each irus is made up of a main body and a swarm of smaller bodies, each with a different physical shape. Both body and swarm are a single creature, however, and an irus can control the smaller bodies as easily as an arm or leg. Should the main body be destroyed, one of the smaller creatures will slowly grow into a new main body.

There is some evidence that all iruses are actually the same species adapted to different environments. For example, a swarm body from one type of irus can cleave off and form a new main body of a different type if it encounters the correct environment.

## Wadirus Drugs

Shady black market dealers have begun to ask unscrupulous adventurers to intentionally provoke wadiruses in order to process their poison into a new form of drug. So far, none of the experimental wadirus drugs have made it to the market, as they have all had horrifying side effects.

## Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey And Analysis Of The Field

The metaphysical process of swarm rejuvenation is complicated, and among the scholars who sought to understand it, many died to irus attacks before one extremely persistent researcher managed to publish a treatise named Swarm Rejuvenation: A Survey and Analysis of the Field, which is currently recognized as the most prominent collection of theories and data on the subject.

According to the text, when an irus's central body is defeated, it spreads the primal energy of its fey self throughout the swarm of creatures that make up its extended body. Each of these creatures is connected to the others and the main body by an invisible web of magical links, similar to arteries or a ley line network, and the web persists after the body's death.

This means that no matter how many of the swarm's constituents are killed, the irus can quickly shift their energy into whichever manages to survive. However, the transfer isn't lossless, and an unpredictable amount of the essence spills out during the process, especially if many of the swarm's constituent creatures also perish. This leads to a significant variation in how long it takes for the irus to rejuvenate, as the more energy it loses, the longer it takes to return.
