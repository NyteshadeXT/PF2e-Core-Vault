# Effect: Mother Suit (Huge)
## Level 15
### 






A matrona wears a massive suit made of stone, iron, and the souls of trapped fey creatures. As its mother suit is damaged, the matrona becomes smaller and more agile.

When it is reduced to 200 Hit Points, the matrona becomes Huge. The reach of the matrona's fist Strike reduces by 5 feet and the matrona's Speeds increase by 10 feet.
