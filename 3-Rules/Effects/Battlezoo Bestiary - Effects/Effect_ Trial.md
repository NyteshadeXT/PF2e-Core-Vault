# Effect: Trial
## Level 1
### 






The kharozat designates an accused (an individual or a group of any size) and determines a sentence. Until the accused completes its sentence or the kharozat is persuaded to commute the sentence, the kharozat and its summoned creatures gain a +2 status bonus on attack rolls and skill checks against the accused.
