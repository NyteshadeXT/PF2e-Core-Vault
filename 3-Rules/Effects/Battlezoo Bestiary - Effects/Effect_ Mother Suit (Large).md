# Effect: Mother Suit (Large)
## Level 15
### 






A matrona wears a massive suit made of stone, iron, and the souls of trapped fey creatures. As its mother suit is damaged, the matrona becomes smaller and more agile.

When reduced to 100 Hit Points, it becomes Large. The reach of the matrona's fist Strike reduces by 10 feet and the matrona's Speeds increase by 20 feet.
