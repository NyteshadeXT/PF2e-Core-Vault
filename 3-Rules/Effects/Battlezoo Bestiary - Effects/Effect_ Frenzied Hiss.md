# Effect: Frenzied Hiss
## Level 1
### 






The salt mother hisses terribly, spurring her entire pack into a violent frenzy. The salt mother and all salt stalkers within 60 feet deal 4 additional damage with melee Strikes and take a -1 status penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 minute, after which affected creatures are temporarily immune to the salt mother's Frenzied Hiss for 1 hour.

When a salt mother uses Frenzied Hiss, each affected salt stalker can spend its reaction to Stride up to its Speed, but it must end its movement closer to either the salt mother or a visible enemy.
