# Effect: Life-Draining
## Level 1
### 






The flourishing plant life that covers your body is a part of you, but it draws nutrients from your blood, making you weaker the more the flowers grow. As the plants grow, you need to spend more and more time recuperating. Recuperating in the sunshine lowers this duration, as it feeds the flowers, speeding your recovery.

**Mild Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] as the plants feed off your life force. This condition lasts until you spend 3 consecutive actions to rest and do nothing.

**Moderate Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you spend 20 minutes recuperating by resting and doing nothing. If you spend this time basking in sunshine, it instead takes 10 minutes.

**Severe Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] until you spend 2 hours napping. While napping, you're [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and can't take actions or engage in exploration activities, but a creature can wake you with a single action with the manipulate trait. If you spend this time napping in natural sunlight, it instead takes 1 hour. You're fatigued until you can get a full night's rest.
