# Stance: Wolf Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Wolf Stance|Wolf Stance]]

You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

If you're flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.
