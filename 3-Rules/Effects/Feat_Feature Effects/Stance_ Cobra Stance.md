# Stance: Cobra Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Cobra Stance|Cobra Stance]]

You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks. These deal 1d4 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, deadly d10, finesse, unarmed, and venomous traits.

While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.
