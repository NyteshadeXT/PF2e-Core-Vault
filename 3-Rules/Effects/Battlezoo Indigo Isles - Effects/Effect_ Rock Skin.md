# Effect: Rock Skin
## Level 1
### 






During your daily preparations, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage (except adamantine). Any time this resistance prevents damage, it decreases by 1, to a minimum of 0. However, when your resistance is below 5, it slowly recovers itself over time; for every 10 minutes, it increases by 1, to a maximum of 5.
