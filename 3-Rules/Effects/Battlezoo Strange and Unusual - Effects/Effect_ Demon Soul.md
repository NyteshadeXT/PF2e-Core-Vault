# Effect: Demon Soul
## Level 1
### 






The lucent demonsheep grows to Medium size, and its body lights on fire, causing its Strikes to deal 1d6 additional fire damage. Its wool becomes a dense cloud of choking black smoke, granting it Concealement to all other creatures. Finally, the lucent demonsheep gains smoke vision, allowing it to see through smoke.
