# Effect: Myth Mask
## Level 1
### 






A typical lorekith carries three masks that they modify as needed; the hero, the mentor, and the villain. They can swap masks with an Interact action, and they gain benefits based on which mask they currently wear. Their masks have a Hardness of 3 and 12 Hit Points, with a Broken Threshold of 6, and a creature can target a lorekith's mask using the lorekith's AC and saves, though the masks aren't normally affected by area effects while in the lorekith's possession. If their mask is broken, a lorekith loses access to that mask's benefits until they Craft a new one, which costs them no valuable materials and takes only 1 day. Rarer lorekith might have access to more masks than these basic three.

*   **Hero** The lorekith gains fast healing 2.
*   **Mentor** The lorekith gains a +1 status bonus to skill checks.
*   **Villain** The lorekith gains a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Additional Lorekith Masks

While nearly every lorekith has worn a mask for the essential roles of a story, some have more specific tastes, creating masks such as the conflagration, the dragon, or the fool.

*   **The Conflagration** The lorekith gains resistance 5 to fire, and its shadow puppet Strike's damage changes to fire.
*   **The Dragon** The lorekith's Intimidation bonus becomes +13.
*   **The Fool** The lorekith gains a +2 status bonus to saves against mental effects.
