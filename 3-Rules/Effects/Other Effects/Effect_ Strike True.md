# Effect: Strike True
## Level 1
### 






The target rolls twice and takes the higher result. This strike deals an extra die of damage on a hit if the attacker has fewer than half their maximum Hit Points, or two extra dice if they have fewer than one quarter their maximum Hit Points. This is a fortune effect.
