# Glyph of Warding (Blast) *Hazard 8*  
[magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait") [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait") [ward](ward.md "Ward Trait")  

**Stealth** DC 28 (trained) to notice faint glowing sigils on the ceiling; *detect magic* reveals the glyph’s aura.  
**Description** A glyph inscribed on the ceiling erupts in a spray of acid whenever an intruder passes beneath it. Loyal servants of the chamber’s master can pass without danger.  

---
**Disable** DC 28 [[Skills#Arcana|Arcana]] (expert) to counteract the ward, or DC 28 [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (expert) with thieves’ tools to disrupt the runes.  

**Acid Burst** `pf2:r`  
**Trigger** A creature not attuned to the glyph passes beneath it.  
**Effect** The glyph explodes in a 10-foot burst. All creatures in the area take `dice: 6d8` acid damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, creatures are also [[sickened|sickened 1]].  

---
**Reset** None. Once triggered, the glyph burns out.
