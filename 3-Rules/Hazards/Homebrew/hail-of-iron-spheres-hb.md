# Hail of Iron Spheres *Hazard 2*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 20 (trained) to notice the trap mechanism hidden above the balance beam

A cleverly hidden mechanism launches iron spheres at creatures traversing a precarious balance beam. The balance beam spans a 15-foot gap in a dungeon corridor. When a creature steps onto the beam, the trap launches a barrage of small, heavy iron spheres at all creatures on the beam, making traversal dangerous and potentially causing falls.

- **Disable** DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (trained) to disarm the launching mechanism or DC 18 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to jam the mechanism with brute force.

- **AC** 14, **Fort** +10, **Ref** +8
- **Hardness** 5, **HP** 20 (BT 10)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Fire Iron Spheres** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The trap activates when a creature moves onto the balance beam.

**Effect** The trees throughout the tainted grove shift their roots wildly, making the area difficult terrain, then the Abyss-warped trees roll initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

Once triggered, the trap continues launching iron spheres each round for up to 3 rounds. Each creature on the balance beam must attempt the Reflex save every round until the trap ceases firing or the creature moves off the beam.
```

**Reset** The trap automatically reloads after 1 minute and is ready to activate again.

*Homebrew*




### **Effect**

- **Ranged Strike**: +9 (range increment 20 feet), damage 1d4 bludgeoning
    - Targets all creatures on the beam, as the spheres rain down.
    - Reflex DC 17: On a critical failure, the creature takes full damage and falls from the beam unless they succeed at a DC 16 Acrobatics check to catch themselves.
    - Reflex DC 17: On a success, the creature takes half damage and remains standing.
