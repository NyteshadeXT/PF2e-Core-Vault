# False Elevator *Hazard -1*  
[simple](3-rules/trait_reference/simple.md "Simple Hazard Trait")   [mechanical](3-rules/trait_reference/mechanical.md "Complex Hazard Trait") [trap](3-rules/trait_reference/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [unique](3-rules/trait_reference/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait") 

**Stealth** DC 18 (trained)  
**Description** After the someone stands within the elevator the doors close and the contraption crushes everything contained within.

---
**Disable** [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 18 (trained) to jam the door open.

**Collapse** `pf2:r` **Trigger** Someone enters the elevator; **Effect** The trap deals `dice: 2d6` 2d6 bludgeoning damage to any creature trapped within. Due to the confined space there is no saving throw to avoid.

---
**Routine** `pf2:1` ([force](3-Rules/trait_reference/force.md), [conjuration](3-Rules/trait_reference/conjuration.md)) The trap emits a blast of force. Each creature in the hall must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save with the same results as Force Blast. If this forced movement would cause a creature to collide with a solid object or fall downstairs or out a window, that creature takes an additional `2d10+11` bludgeoning damage (or 20 damage due to a fall).

---
**Reset** The eleveator is destroyed after it is traiggered.
