# Devious Spiked Pit *Hazard 8*  
[environmental](environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait") [mechanical](mechanical.md "Mechanical Item Trait") [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait") [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

**Stealth** DC 28 (trained) to notice faint seams in the trap door.  
**Description** The far end of the hallway is a false dead end. A trap door covers a 10-foot by 10-foot pit. An [illusory wall](illusory-wall.md) 30 feet down disguises the true depth, while the bottom 60 feet below is warded with *silence*. The walls are unnaturally slick and magically greased, making climbing extremely difficult.  

---

**Disable** DC 28 [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to jam the trap door or unravel the locking mechanism; DC 30 [[Skills#Arcana|Arcana]] to dispel the *illusory wall* or *silence*.  

**Devious Fall** `pf2:r`  
**Trigger** A creature steps onto the false floor.  
**Effect** The trap door collapses, dropping the creature into the pit.  

- The first 30 feet appear solid due to the *illusory wall*. A falling creature can attempt a DC 26 basic Reflex save to [[Rules/Skills#Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] before plunging deeper.  
- The pit is actually 60 feet deep: the creature takes `dice: 6d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall.  
- At the bottom, sharpened spikes deal `dice: 4d10` piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [[prone]] and takes double spike damage.  
- Because of the *silence*, no sound of the fall or cries for help escape the pit.  

**Walls**: The walls are magically greased and unnaturally smooth. A creature can attempt to climb out with a DC 30 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check, made more difficult by the conditions. Success allows slow ascent, while failure by 5 or more causes the climber to fall back down. Magic such as *spider climb* or flight bypasses this obstacle.  

---

**Reset** The trap door resets automatically after 1 minute. The magical effects persist until dispelled.
