# Hidden Pit _Hazard 7_

[environmental](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-684ce9a871a48191a2db84efb6689ef7-pathfinder-2nd-edition/c/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait") [mechanical](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-684ce9a871a48191a2db84efb6689ef7-pathfinder-2nd-edition/c/mechanical.md "Mechanical Item Trait") [trap](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-684ce9a871a48191a2db84efb6689ef7-pathfinder-2nd-edition/c/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")

**Stealth** DC 27 (Trained)  
**Description** A cleverly disguised section of floor collapses into a spiked pit below.

---

**Disable** DC 25 [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] to brace the false floor or jam the release mechanism from a safe edge.

**Collapsing Cover** `pf2:r` **Trigger**: A creature steps onto the concealed panel. **Effect** The floor gives way. The triggering creature falls 30 feet, taking `dice: 3d6` bludgeoning damage. The creature can attempt a DC 25 basic Reflex save to [[Rules/Skills#Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] before falling; on a success, it stops at the edge and doesn’t fall. If it falls to the bottom, it lands on spikes for `dice: 4d10` piercing damage. On a critical failure on the Reflex save, the creature falls prone and takes double spike damage.

**Getting Out** Creatures in the pit can climb out with a DC 23 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] (Climb) check. The pit’s smooth walls don’t allow Take 10/Assurance to bypass this challenge.

---

**Reset** Replacing and re-securing the false floor (typically 10 minutes) resets the trap; otherwise, it remains an open pit until repaired.
