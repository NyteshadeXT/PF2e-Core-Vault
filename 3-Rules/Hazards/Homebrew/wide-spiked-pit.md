# Wide Spiked Pit *Hazard 7*  
[environmental](environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait") [mechanical](mechanical.md "Mechanical Item Trait") [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

**Stealth** DC 26 (trained) to notice the faint seams around the pit cover.  
**Description** The floor sections on either side of the stairs conceal wide spiked pits.  

---
**Disable** DC 26 [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) to jam the trap door’s hinges or reinforce the cover.  

**Collapsing Floor** `pf2:r`  
**Trigger** A creature steps onto the pit’s false floor.  
**Effect** The cover collapses. The triggering creature falls 40 feet, taking `dice: 4d6` bludgeoning damage, then lands on sharpened spikes for `dice: 4d10` piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, the creature falls prone and takes double spike damage.  

**Walls**: Smooth and angled inward. DC 27 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] to Climb out.  

---
**Reset** None. Once the false floor collapses, the pit remains open.
