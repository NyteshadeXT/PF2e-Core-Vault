# Scout
You're an expert in espionage and reconnaissance, able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather intelligence, sneak through enemy lines and report back to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively take down your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you and your companions and keep you all alert to approaching danger. It's not just enemies that you scout out; you also survey the land. You're able to discover the easiest routes as safely as possible and remain watchful while moving with speed and subtlety. The responsibility of the party's safe passage depends on you performing your scouting duties with constant and consistent effort. You take pride in your vigilance, and your allies trust your guidance to ensure the safety of everyone traveling.
