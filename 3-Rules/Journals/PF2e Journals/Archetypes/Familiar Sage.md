# Familiar Sage
According to Tian Xia's scholars, spirits and apparitions are commonly believed to embody various aspects of life, objects, and concepts. These spirits might choose a form that strikes their fancy or inhabit one that best reflects their personality, temperament, or philosophy. Sometimes, an apparition achieves a greater awareness that results in a spiritual awakening. Such entities might develop a strong magical connection to the world that elevates and separates them from others of their kind. Over time, they might form connections or mystical bonds with worthy individuals to serve throughout their chosen partner's lifetime, possibly continuing on to watch over their partner's descendants and becoming spiritual household guardians. Typically, these apparitions are remnants of humanoid souls or personifications of spiritually infused items or locations, but in some cases, primal spirits form similar bonds, granting a greater connection to the five elements and the natural world. Regardless of the fundamental nature of these spirits, those who have mastered the ability to conjure and control a familiar can form a bond with them that unlocks a unique and potent well of shared magical energy.
