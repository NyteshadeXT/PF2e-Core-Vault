# Gladiator
The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the bestâ€”and the fame isn't bad either. You always do your best work under the fervent gaze of spectators, and by work, you of course mean violence.

## [[Feats/Gladiator Dedication|Gladiator Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Impressive Performance

* * *

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Gladiatorial Lore. If you were already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll Performance for your initiative. If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor directly assisting any participants, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter of whether or not a combat has spectators.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Gladiator archetype.

## [[Feats/Fancy Moves|Fancy Moves]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Gladiator Dedication, expert in Performance

* * *

You show off your fighting style to discourage your foes. You can use Performance to Demoralize.

## [[Feats/Play to the Crowd|Play to the Crowd]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Gladiator Dedication

**Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a non-trivial combat encounter with spectators.

* * *

You show off for the crowd. Attempt a Performance check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to Make an Impression on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

*   A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Stage Fighting|Stage Fighting]] Feat 4

You pull punches to give a better show. You don't take the usual -2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn't have the nonlethal trait.

## [[Feats/Performative Weapons Training|Performative Weapons Training]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Gladiator Dedication

* * *

You're skilled with flashy weapons and can use them to great effect. You have familiarity with the bo staff, dueling cape, spiked chain, sword cane, trident, war flail, and whip. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat these as simple weapons. The GM may add other martial weapons to this list as appropriate for the world or region you are playing in.

Whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
