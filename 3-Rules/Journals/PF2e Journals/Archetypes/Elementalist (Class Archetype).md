# Elementalist (Class Archetype)
You revere the elements as the building blocks of creation and the source of all life. You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the elements. There are many paths to elementalism, and many classes can become elementalists. As the most basic building blocks of matter, the elements can be shaped to your specific training and understanding. The study of elementalism expands every day.

You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace either the philosophy of four elements common in the Inner Sea or the five-element cycle prevalent in Tian Xia. This is often a balance, but some elementalists feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other elements to support and augment their favored.

## Elemental Magic (1st)

You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list.

**Elementalist Adjustments:** Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use.

**Druid Elementalist Adjustments:** If you're a druid of the storm order and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge, with updraft.

**Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments:** If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline.

**Wizard Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rdrank spell as the advanced school spell.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Feats/Familiar|Familiar]], 6th [[Feats/Current Spell|Current Spell]] (**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication, air or water is in your elemental philosophy), [[Feats/Enhanced Familiar|Enhanced Familiar]], [[Feats/Water Step|Water Step]] (**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication, water is in your elemental philosophy)

### Elemental Philosophy

Choose an elemental philosophy, which determines which elements you can use. The options available in this book are as follows.

*   **Elemental Cycle:** Earth, fire, metal, water, wood
    
*   **Inner Sea Elementalism:** Air, earth, fire, water
    

Every elementalist has the spells from the universal elemental spells list. Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your other spells. Your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits.

You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to. For example, an Inner Sea elementalist couldn't select the Reverberating Spell feat, use Redirect Elements against a metal or wood spell, or choose a metal or wood ability for their Elemental Familiar.

## [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice: air, earth, fire, or water.

You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned elemental trait.

This attunement lasts until you next make your daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the elementalist archetype.

## [[Feats/Dousing Spell|Dousing Spell]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target.

If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Acid or Fire Damage]], the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately.

The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).

## [[Feats/Elemental Familiar|Elemental Familiar]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]], [[Feats/Familiar|Familiar]]

* * *

Your familiar becomes an elemental spirit capable of taking on aspects of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Other than taking the form of an elemental instead of an animal, this familiar continues to use all the same rules as other familiars.

Your familiar gains one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following elemental familiar abilities. While your familiar has an elemental familiar ability, your familiar is composed of the associated elemental matter and gains the matching elemental trait. You can't select more than one elemental familiar ability at a time.

*   **Air** If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]]
*   until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.
*   **Earth** Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to half your level.
*   **Fire** Your familiar sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and emits warmth. Creatures that remain within a @Template\[emanation|distance:15\] don't take damage from severe environmental cold.
*   **Metal** Your familiar gains resistance to physical damage from metal weapons equal to half your level.
*   **Water** Your familiar can move through a gap at least 2 inches wide without [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeezing]] and can Squeeze through a gap at least 1 inch wide.
*   **Wood** If your familiar remains in bright light for 1 round, it gains fast healing equal to half your level. Once it is out of bright light, this effect ends.

## [[Feats/Burning Spell|Burning Spell]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire.

If the next action you use is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] equal to the spell rank, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals persistent fire damage.

The spell gains the fire trait.

## [[Feats/Expanded Elemental Magic|Expanded Elemental Magic]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

You reach new understandings of the elements, taking an expansive view. Add to your elemental philosophy any of the following elements it doesn't already include: air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood.

## [[Feats/Metabolize Element|Metabolize Element]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

**Trigger** You take damage from a foe's spell or magical ability with the air, earth, fire, or water trait.

* * *

You rapidly metabolize the elemental particles in your opponent's spell to gain a boost of energy. You gain the [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] condition until the end of your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Step or Stride.

## [[Feats/Reverberating Spell|Reverberating Spell]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]], metal is in your elemental philosophy

* * *

Your spell disorients your targets with a metallic clangor. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage in an area (such as a burst, line, or cone), the spell deals an additional 1d8 sonic damage and all creatures who fail their save against the spell are [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round. Targets who critically fail their saves against this spell are instead deafened for 1 minute.

The spell gains the sonic trait.

## [[Feats/Growth Spell|Growth Spell]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]], wood is in your elemental philosophy

* * *

You enhance your spell with elemental wood, causing your magic to expand and grow beyond its original limitations. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, expand the area of the spell. For bursts, expand the radius by 5 feet; for cones, expand the cone by 10 feet; and for lines, expand the length by 15 feet.

The spell gains the wood trait.

## [[Feats/Rockslide Spell|Rockslide Spell]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

You enhance your spell with elemental earth, causing chunks of stone to litter the ground.

If the next action you use is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, a number of 5-foot squares in the area equal to the spell rank become difficult terrain for 1 round. These squares must be on the ground, and the entire area of difficult terrain must be contiguous.

The spell gains the earth trait.

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Elementalist Dedication|Elementalist Dedication]]

* * *

You enhance your spell with elemental air, using the wind to find your target and carry your magic around cover.
