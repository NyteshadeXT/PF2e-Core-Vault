# Viking
To go 'viking' is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the 'whale-road') to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Feats/Reactive Shield|Reactive Shield]]; 6th [[Feats/Shielded Stride|Shielded Stride]]; 10th [[Feats/Quick Shield Block|Quick Shield Block]]

## [[Feats/Viking Dedication|Viking Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics

* * *

Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in Sailing Lore. When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your Athletics check to Swim, you get a critical success instead.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Viking archetype.

## [[Feats/Hurling Charge|Hurling Charge]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication

* * *

You make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, Stride, and then Interact to draw another weapon.

**Special** If you are raging, and end the Stride adjacent to an enemy, that enemy is Off-Guard against the next Strike you make against it with the weapon you drew before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Viking Weapon Familiarity|Viking Weapon Familiarity]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication

* * *

From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional viking combat techniques, and you soon learned to handle axe, sword, and shield in battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows. You gain the Shield Block reaction. Additionally, you have familiarity with the battle axe, hatchet, longsword, shield boss, shield spikes, and shortswordâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as simple weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## [[Feats/Second Shield|Second Shield]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication

**Trigger** Your Shield Block causes your shield to break or be destroyed.

* * *

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can Interact to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield-for example, a table or chair- you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the Raise a Shield action, as normal.

## [[Feats/Into the Fray|Into the Fray]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication

**Requirements** You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon in one hand and a shield in another hand.

* * *

You charge into battle with shield-splintering fury. You Leap, Stride, or Swim. Make two melee Strikes during this movement, one with your one-handed melee weapon and one with your shield or a weapon attached to the shield (like a shield boss or shield spikes). You can make these Strikes at any points during your movement, and each must target a different enemy. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made both attacks.
