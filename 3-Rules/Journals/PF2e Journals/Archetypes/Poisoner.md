# Poisoner
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the insidious power of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone, suitably powdered, induces powerful hallucinations and delirium. The sap of a rare tree inflicts such agony that death seems preferable. The deadly medicines of nature have been molded to create concoctions capable of both killing and debilitating. Neither option is pleasant for the unfortunate recipient. You are a student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous foe indeed.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Feats/Blowgun Poisoner|Blowgun Poisoner]], [[Feats/Poison Resistance|Poison Resistance]]; 6th [[Feats/Poison Weapon|Poison Weapon]], [[Feats/Tenacious Toxins|Tenacious Toxins]]; 8th [[Feats/Sticky Poison|Sticky Poison]]; 10th [[Feats/Improved Poison Weapon|Improved Poison Weapon]], [[Feats/Pinpoint Poisoner|Pinpoint Poisoner]]

## [[Feats/Poisoner Dedication|Poisoner Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

* * *

You make a point of always having a few toxins near at hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might prove useful. You gain the advanced alchemy benefits. You can use advanced alchemy to create four alchemical poison consumables each day. You remember alchemical poison formulas and don't need a formula book for them.

**Special** Once you take a dedication feat, you can't select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.

## [[Feats/Poisoner's Twist|Poisoner's Twist]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Poisoner Dedication, trained in Medicine

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful melee Strike that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.

* * *

Poisons attack specific parts of the body-one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal 1d6 damage of the required Strike's damage type and 1d6 poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal 2d6 damage of each type.

## [[Feats/Advanced Poisoncraft|Advanced Poisoncraft]] Feat 6

You can create up to 6 poisons per day with advanced alchemy.

* * *

**Special** At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a second time to increase the number to 8.

## [[Feats/Poison Coat|Poison Coat]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Poisoner Dedication

In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines, and just brushing against them can prove deadly. You expend a contact or injury poison and spend 10 minutes brushing that poison onto your clothing or weaving sharp, poisoned needles into the garment's fabric. You can have only one poison suffused into your clothing at a time. You can use the [[Actions/Once Bitten|Once Bitten]] reaction while you have a poison suffused in this way.

## [[Feats/Acquired Tolerance|Acquired Tolerance]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Poisoner Dedication

**Trigger** You fail a save against a poison.

* * *

A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can help the body build up resistance against a more deadly dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you can't use it against a different type of poison until after you make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used the reaction on a save against [[Equipment/Giant Scorpion Venom|Giant Scorpion Venom]], you could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but you couldn't use it against [[Equipment/Wyvern Poison|Wyvern Poison]].

## [[Feats/Chemical Contagion|Chemical Contagion]] Feat 18

**Prerequisites** Poisoner Dedication

* * *

Your injury poisons can spray onto creatures. You gain the toxicologist alchemist's greater field discovery.
