# Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield between you and your enemies. You've focused your training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself and those around you. Darting around in search of cover isn't necessary when you carry your cover with you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge that you have your most trusted companion at your side: your shield. This long-lasting fighting style has existed for ages due to its practicality and propensity for survival among its practitioners. While some prefer the nimbleness of a free hand or the power of a larger weapon, a bastion knows that surviving a little bit longer is worth more than a quicker or stronger attack

**Additional Feats** 6th [[Feats/Shielded Stride|Shielded Stride]]; 8th [[Feats/Reflexive Shield|Reflexive Shield]], [[Feats/Shield Warden|Shield Warden (Fighter)]]; 10th [[Feats/Quick Shield Block|Quick Shield Block]]; 12th [[Feats/Mirror Shield|Mirror Shield]]

## [[Feats/Bastion Dedication|Bastion Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** Shield Block

* * *

You are particularly skilled at using a shield to protect yourself in combat. You gain the [[Feats/Reactive Shield|Reactive Shield]] fighter feat.

## [[Feats/Disarming Block|Disarming Block]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication, trained in Athletics

**Trigger** You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a held weapon.

* * *

With deft and practiced movement, you block at an angle to potentially dislodge the weapon. You attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.

## [[Feats/Nimble Shield Hand|Nimble Shield Hand]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication

* * *

You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other tasks that require the dexterity of a hand. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action.

You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.

## [[Feats/Drive Back|Drive Back]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication

**Access** Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

**Trigger** An enemy within your reach Strikes an ally adjacent to you.

**Requirements** You have your shield raised.

* * *

You push the enemy back and attempt to intercede between the foe and your ally. You attempt to Shove the triggering enemy with your shield just as it attacks, pushing it back just after the attempt. Your shield has the shove trait for this Shove attempt. If the shove succeeds, you throw off your enemy's timing, and the enemy takes a –1 circumstance penalty on its attack roll against your ally.

## [[Feats/Destructive Block|Destructive Block]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication

* * *

You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense of your shield.

When you Shield Block, you can reduce the damage to yourself by double the shield's Hardness, but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it would have taken (before applying its Hardness).

You can't use Destructive Block if your shield can't typically be broken or destroyed, such as if you're using an [[Equipment/Indestructible Shield|Indestructible Shield]].

## [[Feats/Shield Salvation|Shield Salvation]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication

* * *

You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead.

Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it thoroughly, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
