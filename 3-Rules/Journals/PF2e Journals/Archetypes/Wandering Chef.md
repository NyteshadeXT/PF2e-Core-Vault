# Wandering Chef
No matter where you go in Tian Xia, one thing you can always find with some reliability is good food. Tian Xia's many talented chefs practice a wide array of cooking techniques, and many can be found traveling between the continent's states and regions as frequently as any adventurer. Chefs from Zi Ha wander to expand their knowledge of cooking techniques, while culinarians from the Lung Wa Successor States visit foreign courts to display their pride in their regional cuisine.
