# Celebrity
You're a special personality... and you know it. You're not merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type of performer, you could be known for any occupation. You know how to use your position to command the attention of others or steal it away from those around you. While you're in a room all eyes are on you, and you love it. Your life is a show, and you are here to steal the love and admiration of everyone watching.

## [[Feats/Command Attention|Command Attention]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication

* * *

You command the attention of all around you with style, ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of your next turn. Whenever a creature in a 30-foot emanation around you attempts a saving throw against a different visual effect, it gets a result one degree of success better than it rolled. This is a fortune effect.

When an enemy within the aura attempts to use a visual effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a medusa's Focus Gaze), it must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature except you.

Allies in the aura can attempt to Hide even if they don't have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.
