# Fan Dancer
Fan dancers display exceptional elegance and control as they drift across the stage, specializing in spinning movements that are, at times, like a trickling brook and, at others, a swift and powerful river. While some fan dancers use their skills to gain the advantage in combat, others adeptly manipulate their fans to distract their enemies and create openings for their allies.

Some fan dancer abilities require you to be wielding one or more fans, which can be a fighting fan or a normal fan used as an improvised weapon.

Characters with Tian Xia origin have access to the fan dancer archetype.
