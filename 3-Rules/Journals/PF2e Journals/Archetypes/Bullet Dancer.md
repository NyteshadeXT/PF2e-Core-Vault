# Bullet Dancer
While most monastic orders and traditional fighting schools shun firearms as loud and unreliable technology for unskilled conscripts, you fuse flourishing feints and ricocheting gunplay into a whirling ballet of bullets. As a bullet dancer, you might become the target of brash duelists and gladiators looking to make a name for themselves. But you tend to welcome the attention and might have proven your reputation while dancing your deadly ballet in tournaments from Tymon to Goka. You've found your fluid motions and explosive attacks to be surefire crowd-pleasers, even as they serve to confound and shock your foes.

**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Bullet Dancer Dedication|Bullet Dancer Dedication]]

The fiery blaze of your weapons combined with your unorthodox technique leaves your opponents with little opportunity to capitalize on any gaps in your defenses, or properly defend themselves against your onslaught. While in [[Actions/Bullet Dancer Stance|Bullet Dancer Stance]], when you successfully Strike an opponent with a bayonet or reinforced stock attached to your firearm, the next ranged Strike you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as Reactive Strike. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die.

The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.
