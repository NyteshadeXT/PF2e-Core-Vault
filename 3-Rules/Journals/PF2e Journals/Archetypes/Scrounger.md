# Scrounger
You have spent countless hours disassembling and rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving you the skill to create just about anything from the most unlikely materials. While your improvised items don't last long, they tend to be just what you need in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what's in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be needed, provided your constant attempts to break down and reassemble everything aren't a bother. You never know what you may need in the future.

## [[Feats/Scrounger Dedication|Scrounger Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

* * *

While others need specialized tools and a dedicated space, you have found a way to build just about anything, anywhere. You can Craft items even without appropriate tools or a workshop. Additionally, you don't need a physical formula book to remember all of your formulas; you pay the same cost as normal to learn them, but you memorize them all. You gain the Cobble Together activity.

**Cobble Together** (exploration) You Craft a temporary item out of anything, anywhere, with whatever materials happen to be on hand, spending only 10 minutes to perform the initial Crafting check. The temporary item must be one you've memorized or have the formula for, and must be common, non-magical, half your level or lower, and must be a weapon, armor, or a non-consumable piece of adventuring gear (non-consumable adventuring gear appears on page 291 of Player Core). Instead of a single item, you can create 10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. You can create only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for example, while you could create a blank journal or one with random pages, you couldn't use it as a scholarly journal or a religious text.

An item you Cobble Together is a shoddy item, but when creating it you can choose one creature to build it specifically for. That creature doesn't take the normal penalty for using this shoddy item. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number of hours secretly.

**Special** Once you take a dedication feat, you can't select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.

## [[Feats/Reverse Engineering|Reverse Engineering]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** expert in Crafting, Scrounger Dedication

* * *

Your nigh-constant tinkering and fiddling with objects means you are able to reverse engineer items into formulas more effectively than most.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to reverse engineer a formula from an item, and you can attempt a Crafting check to reverse engineer an item after spending 1 day of work setting up instead of 2. Additionally, if you get a critical success on your Crafting check, you can opt to not only create the formula but also reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item's value.

## [[Feats/Magical Scrounger|Magical Scrounger]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Scrounger Dedication, Magical Crafting

* * *

When you Craft a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication, it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item ust still be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear). You can instead Craft it for someone else's use, allowing them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you use it.

## [[Feats/Expert Disassembly|Expert Disassembly]] Feat 7

**Prerequisites** master in Crafting, Scrounger Dedication

* * *

You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer objects to disable them. You can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock.
