# Pirate
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and intimidation all that you could possibly desire. You may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf of a particular nation or another authority, or you may answer to no one but your own capricious whims. Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat prowess to take what you want from those you deem less deserving.

Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers, and many pirates have the swashbuckler class or archetype. Much like a swashbuckler's daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache. For example, if you have the panache class feature, Boarding Assault gains the bravado trait.

**Additional Feats** 4th [[Feats/Antagonize|Antagonize]], [[Feats/You're Next|You're Next]]

## [[Feats/Pirate Dedication|Pirate Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation

* * *

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder and great adventures to embark on. You gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Sailing Lore or for a specific coastal city you have a connection to (such as Port Peril Lore). You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by unstable ground (such as the deck of a ship). Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Boarding Assault|Boarding Assault]] action.

## [[Feats/Pirate Combat Training|Pirate Combat Training]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Pirate Dedication

* * *

You're particularly skilled at wielding the weapons used traditionally by pirates. You gain either the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] or [[Feats/Underwater Marauder|Underwater Marauder]] skill feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. You have familiarity with the following weapons: hatchet, rapier, scimitar, and whipâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as simple weapons. Your GM may add additional martial weapons to this list as appropriate for your world or region.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## [[Feats/Rope Runner|Rope Runner]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** trained in Acrobatics and Athletics, Pirate Dedication

* * *

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb a rope or an Acrobatics check to Balance on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't off-guard while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.

## [[Feats/Walk the Plank|Walk the Plank]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Pirate Dedication

* * *

You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] an opponent. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to Stride up to its Speed immediately. You choose the path the target takes, but you can't force it to move into an obviously harmful space (such as into hazardous terrain or a space where it would fall) unless your check was a critical success. As normal for forced movement, this movement doesn't trigger reactions. The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 10 minutes.
