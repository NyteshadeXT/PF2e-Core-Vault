# Five-Breath Vanguard
Tian elementalists of the School of Five Breaths seek mastery over the five elemental martial arts expressed by the following stances: Ironblood Stance for metal, Mountain Stance for earth, Reflected Ripple Stance for water, Stoked Flame Stance for fire, and Tangled Forest Stance for wood. They're collectively referred to as the elemental stances. Those of the School of Five Breaths who practice martial arts are taught to harness the elemental cycle by learning, mastering, and moving quickly between the elemental stances, creating a versatile and potent martial art form. Monastic training is essentially a requirement for five-breath vanguards, but martial artists from a variety of classes might find ways to master the techniques.
