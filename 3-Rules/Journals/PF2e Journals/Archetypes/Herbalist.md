# Herbalist
The plants around you can provide more remedies than the finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in their use. Nature always provides to those who know how to look, and you have always had a talent for seeing these gifts before you. You can put it to good use, healing those around you with nothing more than what the world provides.

## [[Feats/Herbalist Dedication|Herbalist Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature, Natural Medicine

* * *

You can create natural remedies. You gain the advanced alchemy benefits. You can use advanced alchemy to create 4 alchemical consumables with the healing trait, though the number is reduced by 2 if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. These consumables are called your herbal items. You remember herbal item formulas and don't need a formula book for them.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Herbalist archetype.

## [[Feats/Fresh Ingredients|Fresh Ingredients]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication, expert in Nature

* * *

When using Natural Medicine to Treat Wounds, you can spend a batch of herbs to gain the +2 circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not in wilderness. If you spend a batch of herbs in wilderness, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead.

## [[Feats/Poultice Preparation|Poultice Preparation]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication

* * *

When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand. When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

## [[Feats/Advanced Herbalism|Advanced Herbalism]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication

Your herbalist talents continue to grow with use and you have become potent at making even more remedies from less. You can create up to 6 herbal items per day with advanced alchemy.
