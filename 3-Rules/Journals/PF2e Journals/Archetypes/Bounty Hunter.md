# Bounty Hunter
Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You're accustomed to perusing wanted posters, following up on leads, and pursuing your quarry to hell and back. Once you locate your prey's trail, you're unshakable. Additionally, you have the skills and experience to subdue even the most troublesome mark and bring them in to secure your reward.

## [[Feats/Bounty Hunter Dedication|Bounty Hunter Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Survival

* * *

When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the Hunt Prey action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate a creature that you've observed, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you can designate a target as your prey while Gathering Information about them, in addition to designating them as your prey when Tracking them as normal. If you have already identified your target and selected them as your prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Gather Information about them.

If you already have Hunt Prey, you gain the Monster Hunter feat in addition to the other benefits of this feat.

## [[Feats/Posse|Posse]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Bounty Hunter Dedication

**Requirements** You have designated prey with Hunt Prey.

* * *

By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Seek your prey, to Track your prey, and to Gather Information about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.

This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they're out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM.

## [[Feats/Tools of the Trade|Tools of the Trade]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Bounty Hunter Dedication

You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties back in one piece, or at least alive. You have familiarity with the bola, sap, and whip; for the purposes of proficiency, you treat these weapons as simple weapons. You deal an additional 1d4 precision damage with these weapons when using them to make nonlethal Strikes against your prey while they're offâ€‘guard to you.

In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait.

## [[Feats/Keep Pace|Keep Pace]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Bounty Hunter Dedication

**Trigger** Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you.

Once you are upon your prey, they can't escape. Stride up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
