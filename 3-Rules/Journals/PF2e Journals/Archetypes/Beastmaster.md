# Beastmaster
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers increase, you can command more of them, briefly inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and even communicate with them over vast distances.

**BEASTMASTER ANIMAL COMPANIONS**

If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the basic rules for animal companions. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time-up to four companions-but only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain [[Actions/Call Companion|Call Companion]] to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.

## [[Feats/Beastmaster Dedication|Beastmaster Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature

* * *

You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.

Certain beastmaster feats give you focus spells. When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells. You can Refocus by feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.

## [[Feats/Additional Companion|Additional Companion]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication

* * *

Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).

## [[Feats/Mature Beastmaster Companion|Mature Beastmaster Companion]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication

* * *

All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities.

Your animal companion has greater independence. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your active animal companion can still use 1 action that round on your turn to Stride or Strike. It can do this at any point during your turn, as long as you aren't currently taking an action. If it does, that's all the actions it gets that roundâ€”you can't Command it later.

## [[Feats/Beastmaster's Trance|Beastmaster's Trance]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication

* * *

You can enter a trance that allows you to briefly inhabit the body of one of your animal companions and share its senses. You gain the focus spell beastmaster trance. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

## [[Feats/Swift Guardian|Swift Guardian]] Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion

**Trigger** You roll initiative.

* * *

When danger appears, you quickly send away your active companion and call in a different animal ally. You use Call Companion. The new animal companion typically arrives in the same location as the one that departed, though the GM might adjust this depending on the circumstances and Speeds of the animals. If you have [[Feats/Lead the Pack|Lead the Pack]], you can swap one of your two active companions for an inactive companion.

## [[Feats/Incredible Beastmaster Companion|Incredible Beastmaster Companion]] Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Mature Beastmaster Companion

* * *

Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop. Each of them becomes a nimble or savage animal companion, gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of companion. You choose nimble or savage individually for each companion, including any companion that becomes mature after you take this feat.

## [[Feats/Beastmaster Bond|Beastmaster Bond]] Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication

* * *

You can communicate telepathically with your animal companions within 100 feet. If you're legendary in Nature, you can communicate telepathically with your animal companions anywhere on the planet.

## [[Feats/Beastmaster's Call|Beastmaster's Call]] Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion

**Frequency** once per turn

* * *

You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active companion to provide the companion's support benefit. The projection arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. The projection has the same AC and saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it would take any damage before your next turn, it disappears and the support benefit ends immediately.

## [[Feats/Specialized Beastmaster Companion|Specialized Beastmaster Companion]] Feat 14

**Prerequisites** Incredible Beastmaster Companion

* * *

Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one specialization of your choice. Choose the specialization separately for each companion, including any companion that becomes specialized after you take this feat.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add a different specialization to your nimble and savage companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up to three specializations each.

## [[Feats/Lead the Pack|Lead the Pack]] Feat 16

**Prerequisites** Mature Beastmaster Companion, you have multiple animal companions

* * *

You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to Command them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike, as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can't Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.
