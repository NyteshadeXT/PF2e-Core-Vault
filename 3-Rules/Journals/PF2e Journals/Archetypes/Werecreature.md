# Werecreature
**Rarity** Rare

* * *

You're a werecreature, a humanoid doomed by an ancient primal curse to transform into an animal or an animalhumanoid hybrid under the light of the full moon. You might be a "true werecreature," born to werecreature parents; you might have found yourself afflicted with the primal curse after surviving the bite of another werecreature; or you might have been transformed into a werecreature by powerful magic, perhaps even willingly.

Although humanoids with the ability to transform into animals aren't universally feared, they're looked on with terror in many places because of a confusion with werecreatures or other threats. With the curse both spreading infectiously and robbing the afflicted control of their actions, those suspected of being werecreatures can rarely live in peace.

While many werecreatures have little control over their own transformations, formal training or an exceptionally strong will has enabled you to exert a degree of mastery over the beast that rages within you, allowing you not only to assume your bestial shape at will but also retain your own mind while doing so. In many cases, this results in being able to prevent spreading the curse as well. This mastery is more common in societies that embrace or accept werecreatures, such as Ulfen countries in northern Avistan and communities of beastkin, wherever they can be found.

## [[Feats/Werecreature Dedication|Werecreature Dedication]] Feat 2

**Requirements** You were born into a lineage of true werecreatures or were afflicted with the curse of the werecreature.

* * *

You're a werecreature, able to shift between your humanoid shape, an animal shape, and a monstrous hybrid of the two. You gain the beast and werecreature traits. Choose your werecreature type from the table below.

Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] feat but also a weakness to silver equal to half your level. You gain the [[Actions/Change Shape|Change Shape]] action. On the night of the full moon, you automatically use Change Shape to assume your hybrid shape, and you can't voluntarily activate or dismiss Change Shape until sunrise.

* * *

**Special** If you're a beastkin, you can use unarmed attacks from your hybrid shape while you're in your werecreature hybrid shape. These forms are otherwise separate.
