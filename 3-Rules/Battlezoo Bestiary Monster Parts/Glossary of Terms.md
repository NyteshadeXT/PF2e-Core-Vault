# Glossary of Terms
The following terms are used throughout this chapter, presented here so you can quickly look up their definitions without having to flip later in the chapter to their appropriate sections.

**Full Variant** The variant of the monster part crafting system where crafting with monster parts is the only form of itemization.

**Gathering** The process of collecting monster parts from the enemies you defeat.

**Hybrid Variant** The variant in between the full variant and the light variant where crafting with monster parts represents a significant chunk of all itemization, but there are still plenty of other items as well.

**Awakened Property** A special benefit you add to an item, such as extra fire damage or the ability to cast a magic spell.

**Awakening** The process of adding and improving awakened properties on items crafted from monster parts.

**Light Variant** The variant of the monster part crafting system where only a small amount of itemization depends on crafting with monster parts, perfect for replacing the loose coin treasure in a campaign without access to shops.

**Monster Parts** A new currency gathered from defeated monsters and used to synthesize and awaken items.

**Synthesis Benefit** A fundamental benefit gained by an item when the item is synthesized to a certain level, akin to fundamental runes. One synthesis benefit is the ability to awaken the item with one or more awakened properties.

**Synthesizing** The process of creating an item out of monster parts and improving an item's fundamental properties by using more and more powerful monster parts. Synthesizing an item raises its level and grants synthesis benefits based on the type of item.

**Salvaging** The process of taking apart an item made from monster parts to recover some of the component parts.

**Transferring** The process of transferring monster parts from one synthesized item to another, granting the transferred benefits to the new item instead.
