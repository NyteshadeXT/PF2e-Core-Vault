**Path** Technique

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent fire damage as the light continues to sear them; this additional damage has the light trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional fire damage as the light warms from within; this additional damage has the light trait.
*   **8th** The persistent fire damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target must attempt a Fortitude save against the weapon's DC. On a failure, it's blinded by the light for 1 round.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent fire damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances.
*   **14th** The persistent fire damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While suffering from the persistent fire damage, the light limns the creature, outlining it and preventing it from becoming concealed or becoming invisible. A visible creature can't be concealed while suffering from the persistent fire damage; if the creature is invisible, it's concealed while suffering from the persistent fire damage, rather than being undetected.
*   **18th** The persistent fire damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** The persistent light cancels out the darkness. Each time the target takes the persistent fire damage from this property, the light attempts to counteract one darkness effect on the target or the target's belongings with a counteract level of 10 and a counteract modifier of +33.
