# Armor or Shield Imbuement:  Energy Resistant
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must have resistance or immunity to the energy type you choose.
**Effect** You imbue the armor or shield to protect yourself from a particular type of energy. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, or sonic damage. While wearing the armor, or wielding the shield, you gain resistance to the chosen energy damage type equal to this imbued property's imbuing level. Additionally, the armor or shield itself gains the same resistance. If the imbued item is a shield, you can use Shield Block any time you would take the chosen damage type, in addition to its usual trigger. For example, suppose you had a 12th level shield with 11 Hardness, granting you 12 fire resistance. If you took 40 damage from a _[[Fireball]]_, you'd reduce the damage to 28 from the fire resistance. If you then used Shield Bock, you would take 17 fire damage, and your shield, which had 12 fire resistance of its own, would take only 5 fire damage. You can imbue a suit of armor with this property multiple times, though each time you do, you must choose a different type of energy damage, and each one counts separately against the armor's imbuing limit.
