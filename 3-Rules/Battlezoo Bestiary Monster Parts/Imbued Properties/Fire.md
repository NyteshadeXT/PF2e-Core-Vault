# Weapon Imbuement: Fire
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/F/fire|Fire]] [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must have the fire trait or an attack or spell that deals fire damage.
**Effect** You imbue the weapon with burning fire.

### Path: Magic  
*Choose when you first imbue the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or primal*

*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _[[Produce Flame]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Breathe Fire]]_ once per day
*   **6th** The weapon's _[[breathe fire]]_ heightens to 2nd level
*   **8th** The weapon can cast _[[Floating Flame]]_ and _[[Fireball]]_ each once per day, but no longer can cast _burning hands_
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional fire damage
*   **12th** The weapon's _[[fireball]]_ and _[[Floating Flame]]_ heighten to 4th level, and the weapon can cast _[[Wall of Fire]]_ once per day
*   **14th** The additional fire damage increases to 1d4
*   **16th** The weapon's _[[fireball]]_, _[[Floating Flame]]_, and _[[wall of fire]]_ heighten to 6th level
*   **18th** The additional fire damage increases to 1d6
*   **20th** The weapon can cast _[[Falling Stars]]_ once per day

* * *

### Path: Might
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional fire damage
*   **6th** The additional fire damage increases to 1d4
*   **8th** The additional fire damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, Strikes with the weapon deal 1d10 persistent fire damage
*   **12th** The fire damage dealt by this imbued property (including persistent fire damage) ignores resistances
*   **14th** The persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases to 2d10
*   **18th** The additional fire damage increases to 1d8
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying fire damage, the target gains weakness 1 to fire until the beginning of your next turn

* * *

### Path: Technique
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent fire damage
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional fire damage
*   **8th** The persistent fire damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d10 persistent fire damage. (The additional persistent fire damage on a critical hit is cumulative with the regular persistent fire damage, and as normal you add it in only after doubling the regular persistent fire damage)
*   **12th** The fire damage dealt by this imbued property (including persistent fire damage) ignores resistances
*   **14th** The persistent fire damage on a hit increases to 1d8
*   **16th** Foes currently affected by persistent fire damage from the imbued property are distracted as they burn, making them [[Off-Guard]]
*   **18th** The persistent fire damage on a hit increases to 1d10
*   **20th** At the end of a burning foe's turn, when they take damage from the imbued property's persistent fire damage, all foes adjacent to that foe are set on fire as well, taking the same amount of persistent fire damage
