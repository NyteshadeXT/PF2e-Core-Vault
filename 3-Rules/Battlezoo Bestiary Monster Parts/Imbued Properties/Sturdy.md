# Shield Imbuement: Sturdy
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must have Hardness, resistance to physical damage, or resistance to one of the three physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). In some cases, you and the GM might decide together that a monster with resistance to physical damage because it is amorphous or gaseous doesn't provide appropriate parts.

**Effect** You imbue the shield to make it even hardier than other shields. A shield with a sturdy imbued property is hardier than other shields. As long as this imbued property’s level is equal to the item level of the shield it imbues, increase the shield’s Hardness by 3 , Hit Points by 18, and Broken Threshold by 9; for each level the imbued property is below the shield’s item level, reduce this increased Hardness by 1, the increased Hit Points by 6, and the increased Broken Threshold by 3, to a minimum of 0 if the imbued property is 3 or more levels lower than the shield’s item level. If this increases the shield’s Hardness by at least 1, additionally increase the shield’s Hit Points by 2 per Hardness, and the shield’s Broken Threshold by 1 per Hardness.
