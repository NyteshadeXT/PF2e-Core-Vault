*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional poison damage
*   **8th** The persistent poison damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target takes an additional 1d10 persistent poison damage (As normal, the additional persistent poison damage on a critical hit is cumulative with the regular persistent poison damage, and you add it only after doubling the regular persistent poison damage)

If the creature ever removes the persistent poison damage from this property, these conditions immediately end. If you reapply the poison later, you must start again from condition values of 0
