# Wisdom
Divination

Magical

**Type** Perception Item or Skill Item (Wisdom-based skill)

**Parts** The creature must have Wisdom as its highest or second-highest ability modifier

* * *

**Effect** You imbue the item with sagacious wisdom.

*   **8th** The item can cast _[[undefined]]_ once per day as a divine spell, as you wisely deduce the future through your own instincts rather than an external source
*   **14th** The item's _augury_ only takes you a single action activation to cast
*   **17th** When you invest the item, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. The item gains the apex trait
*   **20th** You can choose to have the item cast _[[Spells/Foresight|Foresight]]_ once per day instead of _augury_
