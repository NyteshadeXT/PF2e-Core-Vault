# Weapon Imbuement: Acid
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/A/acid|Acid]] [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Type:** Weapon  
**Parts:** The monster must have the [[Acid]] trait or an attack or spell that deals acid damage.
**Effect:** You imbue the weapon with vitriolic acid.

### Path: Magic  
_Choose when you first imbue the weapon whether the granted spells are arcane or primal._

- **2nd** – The weapon can cast _[[undefined]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level (rounded up).
- **4th** – The weapon can cast _[[undefined]]_ once per day.
- **6th** – The weapon's _acidic burst_ heightens to 2nd level. It can cast either _[[undefined]]_ or _acidic burst_ once per day (but not both).
- **8th** – The weapon's _acidic burst_ heightens to 3rd level. It can cast _acid arrow_ and _acidic burst_ each once per day.
- **10th** – Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage.
- **12th** – The weapon's _acid arrow_ heightens to 4th level. It can cast _[[undefined]]_ once per day.
- **14th** – The additional acid damage increases to 1d4.
- **16th** – The weapon's _acid arrow_ heightens to 6th level and _acid storm_ heightens to 7th level.
- **18th** – The additional acid damage increases to 1d6.
- **20th** – The weapon can cast _[[undefined]]_ once per day, but you can only choose the **acid rain** effect. You can choose the acid rain effect twice in a row.

### Path: Might

- **4th** – Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage.
- **6th** – The additional acid damage increases to 1d4.
- **8th** – The additional acid damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target’s armor (if any) takes 3d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.
- **12th** – The acid damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances.
- **14th** – The acid damage dealt to armor or shield on a critical hit increases to 6d6.
- **18th** – The additional acid damage increases to 1d8.
- **20th** – On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying acid damage, the target gains **weakness 1 to acid** until the beginning of your next turn.

### Path: Technique

- **4th** – Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent acid damage.
- **6th** – Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage.
- **8th** – The persistent acid damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target’s armor (if any) takes 3d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.
- **12th** – The acid damage dealt by this imbued property (including the persistent acid damage) ignores resistances.
- **14th** – The persistent acid damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
- **16th** – The persistent acid damage from this imbued property eats away at a foe’s resistances. Each time a foe or their armor or shield takes persistent acid damage at the end of their turn, their resistances and Hardness decrease by 1 for 1 minute. This effect is cumulative.
- **18th** – The persistent acid damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
- **20th** – On a critical hit, acid eats away at the foe’s innards, and they are _[[undefined]]_.
