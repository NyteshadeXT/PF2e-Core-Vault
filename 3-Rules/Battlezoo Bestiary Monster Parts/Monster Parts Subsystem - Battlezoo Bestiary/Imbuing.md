# Imbuing
Once you've refined an item to a high enough level, you unlock the ability to imbue the item. The necessary level to unlock imbuing varies from item to item; see Tables 4A through 4E for more details. Imbuing an item follows a similar process as refining: add monster parts that meet the requirements for the imbued property you want to add to the item. You can't use monster parts if they do not meet the requirements for the imbued property.

For example, if you are imbuing a cold property, you can't use parts from a monster that doesn't have any cold abilities. Track this value separately from the monster parts you use to refine the item, and if the item is high enough level and of the right type to be imbued multiple times, track the value for each imbued property separately. Continue adding value to the imbued property as you use more parts to imbue the property, just like with refining.

When you reach the values specified in [[undefined]]} (if imbuing a weapon or suit of armor) or [[undefined]] (if imbuing a shield, Perception item, or skill item), the imbued property levels up, potentially granting increased benefits to the item. Just like with refining, the value and benefits are cumulative, and you can keep adding value to increase the imbued property's level further and gain more benefits. An imbued property's level can never be higher than the item's level or your level, whichever is lower. Much like in refining, you can keep contributing monster parts and imbuing the property past that point, and in that case, the imbued property's level increases immediately once you refine the item enough to increase the item's refining level. Unlike refining, which only has a single option depending on the type of item, you can choose from several options when you imbue an item, and some of them have multiple upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your item to match your personal playstyle.

## Imbued Properties

The following imbued properties are available when imbuing items with different kinds of monster parts. Sometimes an imbued property lists that the item gains either a specific spell, or a chosen spell that follows certain criteria. In this case, the item gains a command and Interact activation the same number of actions as the listed spell, with an effect of casting the listed spell. The item's DC for any effects is based on its item level, using the value from the Magic Item DCs table, found in the _Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide_. If the item needs to make a spell attack roll or counteract check, its modifier is equal to its DC - 10.

Some imbued properties, especially for weapons, have multiple upgrade paths, reflecting the different ways you can adjust the imbuing process. These paths are magic (emphasizing thematic spells), might (emphasizing direct damage), and technique (emphasizing special effects and damage over time). If the weapon is capable of holding multiple imbued properties, you can apply the same imbued property to the weapon multiple times as long as you choose a different path each time.

To use an activated ability of an imbued property on a held item, such as a weapon, you must be wielding the item. Any effects are cumulative. For instance, if you wanted to make the ultimate fire sword, you could imbue the sword with fire from each of the magic, might, and technique paths. You would combine the fire damage and persistent fire damage from all three paths to determine the weapon's total effects, meaning you would eventually deal 5d10 Persistent fire Damage on a critical hit!

## Example of Imbuing

The party's level 7 fighter just refined a level 6 longsword out of tyrannosaurus parts (see [[undefined]]). Realizing they could also imbue a property, they decided the only thing better than a tyrannosaurus tooth longsword is one that's on fire! Fortunately, the group recently defeated 2 magma scorpions, gaining 280 gp worth of parts. Since the magma scorpions have the fire trait or an attack or spell that deals fire damage (they have both!), the fighter imbues all the parts into their longsword, choosing to imbue the property of fire. The fighter has three choices of path for this imbued property and chooses the path of might. Imbuing 250 gp of parts increases the imbued property's level to 6 (the current maximum, since the item level of the longsword is 6), and lights the tyrannosaurus tooth longsword aflame, allowing it to deal 1d4 additional fire damage! The final weapon is a _+1 striking fire might (6) tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (6)_ refined to 274 gp!
