# Quick Start Guide for PCs
_If your character is using the Monster Parts system from this book, you can use the following steps to create awesome items for yourself and your teammates out of monster parts._

# Step 1: Slay Monsters

This part works like normal. Normally, you need to kill monsters before you can harvest their parts, though if your group is more peaceful, you might be able to find monster parts as quest rewards, or even unlock the powerful magical effects of monster parts freely given.

# Step 2: Gather Ingredients

Next, you gather ingredients from the monsters you defeated. The GM will tell you how much value the monster parts have, as well as their Bulk. To prevent you from having to carry a lot of materials and keep track of them all, you might want to consider using them right away, but if not, you can hold onto them as long as you want. For more information, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Gathering Ingredients|Gathering Ingredients]]. If you have plenty of downtime, you can try to get more total value of monster parts from a monster's corpse. For more information, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Gathering More from Monsters|Gathering More from Monsters]].

# Step 3: Refine Item

Refining an item with monster parts is the first step towards creating an awesome custom item with the parts you've found. During this step, you can either create the base mundane item from scratch by providing monster parts equal to its Price, or you can start with an existing mundane item. Once you've chosen the item, refine it to make it more powerful, using as many monster parts as you like, as long as they meet the item's refining requirements. For instance, you can refine a sword out of parts from a monster that had slashing or piercing unarmed attacks. As you reach certain threshold values while refining, your item will level up, increasing its item level and potentially gaining more benefits. You can't refine an item higher than your own level. For more information, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Refining|Refining]], and for an example, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Example of Refining|Example of Refining]].

# Step 4: Imbue Item

Imbuing an item is where the item starts getting really interesting. As you continue to refine your item, the item eventually gains capacity to be imbued with special imbued properties. A few types of items can even eventually be imbued multiple times. Just like refining, you can imbue an item by using monster parts that meet the imbued property's requirements. For instance, if you want to imbue an item with fire, you'll need parts from a fire monster or a monster with fire abilities. Just like with refining, as you reach certain thresholds, the imbued property will level up, potentially granting increased benefits. You can't imbue a property on an item to be higher level than the item's own level. For more information, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Imbuing|Imbuing]], and for an example, see [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Example of Imbuing|Example of Imbuing]].
