# Monster Parts Introduction
> _As the creature leapt from the tree, I called upon my tokens to put up a barrier between us, but it decided to spew fire at me instead. Ah, how fortunate! I recently imbued my clothing to resist any harm from fire. Not only did that mean the blast barely singed me as I ducked to the side, it also meant once I killed the thing that I could use its parts to increase that imbuing even further! The only way this could possibly get better was if it knew some useful fire spells too..._

The Monster Parts system allows PCs to upgrade weapons and armor using pieces from foes they defeat. It is a perfect fit for adventures that take place far from civilization, where the PCs need to scrounge and forage for all the gear they need. However, the aesthetics of using the parts of defeated monsters to improve and customize gear can be exciting and rewarding for PCs in all sorts of campaigns. Monster parts can replace some or even all of the standard rewards that PCs would receive, depending upon what works best for your group.

With this system, PCs can gather parts from monsters they defeat and use them to upgrade weapons, armor, and even skill items. The upgrades come in two major types-refinement improves the fundamental abilities of the item, and imbuing adds increasingly powerful special properties, which can sometimes branch along multiple paths. As weapons and armor become more refined, they can eventually be imbued multiple times, becoming truly fearsome armaments. In order to achieve these upgrades, the PCs need to defeat monsters with parts that meet the requirements for the refinement or imbuing.

If you're a player, your next step is to check out the [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Quick Start Guide for PCs|Quick Start Guide for PCs]], which will let you know what you need to do to use the new system. In the end it's pretty simple: you kill monsters and use their parts to first create and then upgrade your weapons, armor, and gear, but as with all new things, it can take a little while to get used to the new way of handling treasure.

Next, you might want to check out some of the benefits you can gain on your items by refining or imbuing them, so you can start planning the paths you'll take and potentially aiming to kill specific types of monsters that provide the parts you'll need.

You can enhance your game further with the backgrounds, items, and especially the innovative archetypes at the end of the chapter, which allow a character to learn spells and special abilities from the monsters they defeat in battle.

If you're a GM, you can start instead with the [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Quick Start Guide for GMs|Quick Start Guide for GMs]]. You'll need to make a few quick decisions on how you want to use the new system, which you can figure out together with the group.

Don't worry, all the math and extra work has been calculated for you, so once you know what you want to do, you'll find a comprehensive set of tables that do the work for you when it comes to figuring out how much value of monster parts to give the PCs so that they can create awesome new items out of monster parts. If you're midway through your campaign and want to convert midstream, there's also advice for how to swap over to the new system quickly and easily with the minimum amount of friction and time spent updating characters, so you can get right to the action.

There are even extra sidebars throughout the section with all sorts of additional tweaks and tips, as well as ways to combine these rules with other variants like automatic bonus progression and relics. The only limit is your own imagination!
