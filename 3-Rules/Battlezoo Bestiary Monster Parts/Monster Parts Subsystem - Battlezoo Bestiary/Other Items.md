# Other Items
Except in the full variant, other magic items exist in the world, using the system from the _Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook_ rather than the rules for upgrading items with monster parts. However, if your group is using the full variant, you might still want to include some types of items other than the ones listed, such as potions or talismans. To do that, just decide what type of monster parts apply towards creating a given item, and let the PCs refine that item by paying the item's Price in monster parts. For instance, you might decide that healing potions made out of monster parts require parts from a creature with the positive trait or blood from a creature with regeneration or fast healing, such as a troll. In that case, a PC could use 12 gp of troll parts to refine a [[Equipment/Healing Potion (Lesser)|Healing Potion (Lesser)]].Â As normal, a character can't use this process to create an item of a level higher than their own.
