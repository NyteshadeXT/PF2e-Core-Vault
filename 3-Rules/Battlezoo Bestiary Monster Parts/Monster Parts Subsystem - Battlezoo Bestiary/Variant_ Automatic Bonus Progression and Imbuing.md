# Variant: Automatic Bonus Progression and Imbuing
What if your campaign uses the automatic bonus progression subsystem? You can still use imbuing, replacing refining with the automatic bonus progression. This works in a simple way for weapons and armor: bonuses happen automatically per the automatic bonus progression rules. Use monster parts to imbue weapons and armor, gaining the ability to imbue the item at the same levels as normal on [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Table 4A: Refinement Benefits by Level (Weapon)|Table 4A: Refinement Benefits by Level (Weapon)]] and [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Table 4B: Refinement Benefits by Level (Amor)|Table 4B: Refinement Benefits by Level (Amor)]].

For shields, either use the normal refining and imbuing rules, or you might consider adding the shield refining rules as an "automatic shield progression" for 1 shield per character since those are the only items that have refinement and aren't part of the automatic bonus progression.

For Perception and skill items, there's one decision you need to consider: imbued properties for skill items and Perception items are intentionally a much lower cost than imbued properties for weapons and armor, to encourage imbuing these items with additional abilities. This works in much the same way that skill and Perception items in the normal magic item rules have extra abilities built in, while weapons and armor only add abilities with property runes. With the automatic bonus progression, a character eventually receives six different skill potencies, but you probably don't want this to mean the character can gain up to six imbued properties allowing them cast six spells per day for not much more than the cost of six scrolls of the same spells. You can easily avoid this by disallowing imbuing of skill and Perception items, but for a middle ground, you might only allow one or two imbued skill items, increase the cost of imbuing these items to double the listed cost, or both. In any case, due to apex items being baked into automatic bonus progression, the apex imbued properties shouldn't be available.
