You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[Fleeing]] condition), release what it's holding, drop [[Prone]], or stand in place. It can't [[Delay]] or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save. On a success, the creature is unaffected. On a failure, for the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command. On a critical failure, the target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command. This is an auditory, enchantment, linguistic, and mental effect
