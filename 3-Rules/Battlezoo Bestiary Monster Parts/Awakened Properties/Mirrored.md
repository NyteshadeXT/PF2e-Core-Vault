# Shield Awakening: Mirrored
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must have a status bonus on saves against magic, golem antimagic, or an ability to counter or reflect magic or ranged attacks, such as Counterspell or spell turning.
**Effect** You awaken the shield with reflective power.

* * *

*   **2nd** The shield gains the following activation:   
    **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** A foe's ranged Strike critically fails against you **Requirements** The shield with the mirrored awakened property is raised
    `pf2:r`  **Effect** You turn a poorly aimed attack back at your foe. Reroll the triggering Strike against the foe who made it, using either the same attack bonus the foe made with that Strike or your most accurate ranged attack bonus with a weapon or unarmed attack, whichever is lower. On a success, the foe suffers the full effect of the reflected attack.
*   **4th** The shield's activation gains a frequency of once per hour instead of once per day.
*   **6th** The activation uses the higher of the same attack bonus the foe made with the triggering Strike or your own ranged attack bonus, instead of the lower.
*   **10th** The trigger changes to "A foe's ranged Strike or ranged spell attack roll critically fails against you," allowing you to use the activation against spells in addition to Strikes. When reflecting a spell, you can choose to use your spell attack bonus on the reflected attack roll if it's higher than the other two options.
*   **12th** The shield's activation gains a frequency of once per 10 minutes instead of once per hour.
*   **16th** The shield's activation triggers any time a foe fails with a ranged Strike or ranged spell attack roll against you, instead of only on a critical failure.
*   **20th** Once per day, you can use the shield's activation with the trigger of "A foe targets you with a spell" instead of the usual trigger. This still counts toward the shield's frequency. When you use this alternate trigger, the shield can reflect even spells that don't have spell attack rolls, and the reflection happens before determining the attack roll or saving throw, but the shield must succeed at a counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modifier +33) against the triggering spell or the reflection fails.
