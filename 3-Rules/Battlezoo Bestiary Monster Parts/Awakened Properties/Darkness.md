**Effect** You awaken the weapon with creeping darkness.

* * *

### Path: Magic  
*Choose when you first awaken the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or divine.*

*   **2nd** The weapon gains a two-action Interact and command activation allowing it to attempt to counteract the _[[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/L/Light|light]]_ cantrip (but not other light effects) with a counteract level equal to half the item's level rounded up.
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Penumbral Shroud|penumbral shroud]]_ once per day.
*   **6th** The weapon can cast _[[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/D/Darkness|darkness]]_ once per day.
*   **8th** The weapon can cast _[[Chilling Darkness|chilling darkness]]_ once per day.
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional cold damage as the darkness saps warmth; this additional damage has the darkness trait.
*   **12th** The weapon's _chilling darkness_, darkness, and _penumbral shroud_ heighten to 4th level.
*   **14th** The additional cold damage increases to 1d4.
*   **16th** The weapon's _chilling darkness_, _darkness_, and _penumbral shroud_ heighten to 6th level.
*   **18th** The cold damage increases to 1d6.

### Path: Might
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional cold damage as the darkness saps warmth; this additional damage has the darkness trait.
*   **6th** The additional cold damage increases to 1d4.
*   **8th** The additional cold damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, darkness shrouds the target's vision, causing everything around it to be concealed to it unless it has darkvision.
*   **12th** The additional cold damage dealt by this awakenned property ignores resistances.
*   **14th** On a critical hit with the weapon, the target must attempt a Fortitude save against the weapon's DC. On a failure, it's blinded for 1 round by magical darkness unless it has greater darkvision; even on a success or critical success, everything around it is concealed to it unless it has greater darkvision.
*   **18th** The additional cold damage increases to 1d8.
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional cold damage, the target gains weakness 1 to darkness until the beginning of your next turn.

* * *
 
### Path: Technique
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent cold damage as encroaching darkness slowly drains their warmth away; this additional damage has the darkness trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional cold damage as the darkness saps warmth; this additional damage has the darkness trait.
*   **8th** The persistent cold damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, darkness shrouds the target's vision, causing everything around it to be concealed to it unless it has darkvision.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent cold damage dealt by this awakened property ignores resistances.
*   **14th** The persistent cold damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While suffering from the persistent cold damage, the shrouding darkness interferes with the target's vision. Everything around it is concealed to it unless it has darkvision. On a critical hit with a weapon, the target must attempt a Fortitude save against the weapon's DC. On a failure, it's blinded for 1 round by magical darkness unless it has greater darkvision; even on a success or critical success, everything around it is concealed to it unless it has greater darkvision.
*   **18th** The persistent cold damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** The persistent darkness devours the light. Each time the target takes the persistent cold damage from this property, the darkness attempts to counteract one light effect on the target or the target's belongings with a counteract level of 10 and a counteract modifier of +33.
