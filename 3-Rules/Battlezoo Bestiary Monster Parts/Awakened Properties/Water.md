# Weapon Awakening: Water
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]  [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/W/Water|Water]] 

**Parts** The monster must have the water trait or an attack or spell with the water trait.
**Effect** You awaken the weapon with flowing water.

* * *

### Path: Magic  
Choose when you first awaken the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or primal.

*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _[[Spout]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up.
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Hydraulic Push]]_ once per day.
*   **6th** The weapon's _[[hydraulic push]]_ heightens to 2nd level.
*   **8th** The weapon can cast _[[Aqueous Orb]]_ once per day.
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional bludgeoning damage from a crashing wave of water; this additional damage has the [[3-Rules/Battlezoo Bestiary Monster Parts/Awakened Properties/Water]] trait.
*   **12th** The weapon's _[[aqueous orb]]_ and _[[hydraulic push]]_ heighten to 4th level and the weapon can cast _[[Hydraulic Torrent]]_ once per day.
*   **14th** The additional bludgeoning damage increases to 1d4.
*   **16th** The weapon's _[[aqueous orb]]_, _[[hydraulic push]]_, and _[[hydraulic torrent]]_ heighten to 6th level.
*   **18th** The additional bludgeoning damage increases to 1d6.
*   **20th** The weapon can cast 9th-level _[[Desiccate]]_ once per day.

* * *

### Path: Might
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional bludgeoning damage from a crashing wave of water; this additional damage has the water trait.
*   **6th** The additional bludgeoning damage increases to 1d4.
*   **8th** The additional bludgeoning damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target is also knocked [[Prone]] by the force of the enormous wave unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against the weapon's DC.
*   **12th** The additional bludgeoning damage dealt by this awakened property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals bludgeoning damage, this benefit only applies to the additional damage.
*   **14th** On a critical hit with the weapon, if the target is knocked [[Prone]], they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the hard landing.
*   **18th** The additional bludgeoning damage increases to 1d8.
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional bludgeoning damage, the target gains weakness 1 to water until the beginning of your next turn.

* * *

### Path: Technique
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent bludgeoning damage as torrents of water continue to pummel them; this additional damage has the [[3-Rules/Battlezoo Bestiary Monster Parts/Awakened Properties/Water]] trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional bludgeoning damage from a crashing wave of water; this additional damage has the [[3-Rules/Battlezoo Bestiary Monster Parts/Awakened Properties/Water]] trait.
*   **8th** The persistent bludgeoning damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target is also knocked [[Prone]] by the force of the enormous wave unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against the weapon's DC.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent bludgeoning damage dealt by this awakened property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals bludgeoning damage, this benefit only applies to the bludgeoning damage from this awakened property.
*   **14th** The persistent bludgeoning damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While suffering from the persistent bludgeoning damage, the target is drenched in water, potentially making their footing slippery. Each turn, they must succeed at a Reflex save against the weapon's DC, or else everywhere they walk, the ground is difficult terrain for them.
*   **18th** The persistent bludgeoning damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** Foes suffering from the persistent bludgeoning damage have difficulty speaking as long as they have the persistent bludgeoning damage, as the sloshing waves pour into their mouth when it opens. Unless they can breathe underwater or don't breathe, they must succeed at a DC 5 flat check every time they use an action with the linguistic trait or cast a spell with a verbal component or the action or spell is disrupted.
