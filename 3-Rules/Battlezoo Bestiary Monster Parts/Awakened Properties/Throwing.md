# Weapon Awakening: Throwing
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must have a ranged unarmed attack or Rock Throwing or a similar ability.
**Effect** You awaken the weapon with advantages when thrown, such as the power to return to you when you throw it.

* * *

*   **2nd** When you make a thrown Strike with this weapon, it flies back to your hand at the end of your turn. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
*   **4th** Instead of flying back to your hand at the end of your turn, the weapon flies back to your hand after each Strike is complete, allowing you to use it to make multiple thrown Strikes with it in sequence.
*   **6th** The weapon's range increment increases by 10 feet.
*   **8th** After making a Strike with the weapon, instead of having it return to your hand, if your next action is a Strike, you can have the weapon Strike starting from the previous target's location. If you do, you use this position to determine the distance, cover, and other factors to the new target. You can continue to do so as long as you continue Striking, and when you stop, the weapon returns to your hand as normal.
*   **10th** The weapon's range increment increases by 20 feet, instead of 10 feet.
*   **12th** When you throw the weapon, it spins with whirling blades or creates a shockwave nearby, dealing 1 splash damage of the weapon's normal type to the target and all adjacent creatures. As normal for splash damage, this damage is combined together against the target on a hit, and it also applies on a failed Strike, but not on a critical failure.
*   **14th** The weapon's range increment increases by 30 feet, instead of 20 feet.
*   **16th** The weapon gains the following activation:    
    **Frequency** once per day
	`pf2:3`  ([[envision]])  **Effect** You spin around, launching myriad duplicates of your weapon at foes all around you. Make thrown Strikes against all foes within 30 feet. These Strikes don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you've finished making all of them.
*   **18th** The weapon's range increment increases by 40 feet, instead of 30 feet.
*   **20th** When you make a thrown Strike with the weapon against a foe, instead of having the weapon return to you, you can choose to hold onto the weapon and have it pull you through the air to the nearest available space to your target along the path of the throw.
