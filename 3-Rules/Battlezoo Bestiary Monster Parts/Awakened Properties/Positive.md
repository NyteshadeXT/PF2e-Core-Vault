# Weapon Awakening: Positive
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]  [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/P/Poison|Poison]] 

**Parts** The monster must have the positive trait or an attack or spell that deals positive damage.
**Effect** You awaken the weapon with the cleansing power of positive energy in order to damage undead. As normal, positive damage only harms undead and other creatures with negative healing, such as dhampirs.

* * *

### Path: Magic  
Choose when you first awaken the weapon for the granted spells to be either divine or primal

*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _[[Vitality Lash]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[heal]]_ once per day
*   **6th** The weapon's _[[heal]]_ heightens to 2nd level
*   **8th** The weapon can cast 3rd-level _[[Infuse Vitality]]_ once per day
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional positive damage
*   **12th** The weapon's _[[heal]]_ heightens to 4th level, and the weapon can cast _[[Breath of Life]]_Â  once per day
*   **14th** The additional positive damage increases to 1d4
*   **16th** The weapon can cast _[[Regenerate]]_ once per day. The weapon's _[[Infuse Vitality]]_ and _[[heal]]_ heighten to 5th level
*   **18th** The additional positive damage increases to 1d6
*   **20th** The weapon's _[[heal]]_ and _[[regenerate]]_ heighten to 8th level

* * *

### Path: Might
*   **2nd** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional positive damage
*   **4th** The additional positive damage increases to 1d4
*   **6th** The additional positive damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the undead is also [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn
*   **10th** The positive damage dealt by this awakened property ignores resistances
*   **14th** On a critical hit, instead of being [[enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn, the undead must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, it's [[enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn, on a success, it's [[enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until then, on a failure, it's [[enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] until then, and on a critical failure, it's destroyed. This effect has the [[incapacitation]] trait
*   **18th** The additional positive damage increases to 1d8
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying positive damage, the target gains weakness 1 to positive until the beginning of your next turn

* * *

### Path: Technique
*   **2nd** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent positive damage
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional positive damage
*   **6th** The persistent positive damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the undead is also [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn
*   **10th** The positive damage dealt by this awakened property (including persistent positive damage) ignores resistances
*   **12th** The persistent positive damage on a hit increases to 1d8
*   **14th** On a critical hit, the undead is [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of your next turn. It must also attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, it's [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] until the end of your next turn instead of enfeebled 2, and on a critical failure, it's destroyed. This effect has the [[incapacitation]] trait
*   **18th** The persistent positive damage on a hit increases to 1d10
*   **20th** Creatures suffering persistent positive damage from this awakened property have difficulty healing from negative energy due to the coruscating positive energy surging through them. If a negative effect would cause the creature to recover Hit Points, it must first succeed at a counteract effect against the awakened property's level of 20 and DC of 43. Even on a successful counteract check, the Hit Points recovered are reduced by 1d10. On a critical success, the creature recovers the full amount
