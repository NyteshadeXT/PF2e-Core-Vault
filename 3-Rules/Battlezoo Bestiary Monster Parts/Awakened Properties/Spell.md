# Skill Item Awakening: Spell
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Type** Skill Item
**Parts** The creature must either possess the skill matching the skill item or be capable of casting the chosen spell

* * *

**Effect** You awaken the item with a magic spell. You can either use one of the suggested spells for the given skill or work with the GM to determine another spell. The spell shouldn't be one that is particularly long-lasting like mage armor and you and the GM should think carefully before granting spells that only affect the caster like true strike. Choose a magical tradition that can cast the spell you chose; the item casts the spell using that tradition. At 4th level, you can awaken a 1st-level spell. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, you can awaken a spell of 1 spell level higher, and if you keep the same spell, the spells heightens to the new maximum level.

Suggested spells for each skill are as follows:

*   **Acrobatics** _[[Gentle Landing]]_
*   **Arcana** _[[Force Barrage]]_
*   **Athletics** _[[Jump]]_
