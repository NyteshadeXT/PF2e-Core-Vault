**Parts** The monster must have the air trait or an attack or spell with the air trait.
**Effect** You awaken the weapon with slicing blades of wind.

* * *

### Path: Magic  
*Choose when you first awaken the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or primal.*

*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _[[Gale Blast|gale blast]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up.
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Gust of Wind|gust of wind]]_ once per day.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **8th** The weapon can cast _[[Wall of Wind|wall of wind]]_ once per day.
*   **10th** The weapon can cast _[[Air Walk|air walk]]_ once per day.
*   **12th** The weapon can cast _[[Elemental Gift|elemental gift]]_ (air only) once per day.
*   **14th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d4.
*   **16th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d6.

* * *

### Path: Might
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **6th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d4.
*   **8th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.
*   **12th** The additional slashing damage dealt by this awaken property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals slashing damage, this benefit only applies to the additional damage.
*   **14th** On a critical hit with the weapon, you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you.
*   **18th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d8.
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional slashing damage, the target gains weakness 1 to air until the beginning of your next turn.

* * *

### Path: Technique
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent slashing damage as blades of wind surround and slash them; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **8th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent slashing damage dealt by this awaken property ignores resistances (as does the damage from hazardous terrain caused by this awaken property's 16th level effect). Even if the main weapon deals slashing damage, this benefit only applies to the slashing damage from this awakened property.
*   **14th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While suffering from the persistent slashing damage, the surrounding blades of air damage the creature the more it moves, slashing at them each time they do. All terrain is hazardous terrain for them, dealing 2 slashing damage for each square through which they move (this includes the movement from being pushed by a critical hit). On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 10 feet away.
*   **18th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 20 feet away.
