# Armor Awakening: Fortification
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Type** Armor (must be medium or heavy)
**Parts** The monster must have resistance or immunity to precision damage or critical hits.

* * *

**Effect** You awaken the armor with powerful fortifications to ward off deadly attacks. This awakened property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2. When the awakened property is at least 6th level, each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a DC 20 Flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. The flat check's DC decreases by 1 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a minimum of DC 13 at 20th level.
