# Weapon Awakening: Wild
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** There are no requirements; you can use any parts.
**Effect** Sometimes you just can't find enough parts of the same type to properly awaken your weapon, but you still want to awaken it with something. From that desperation and the haphazard imbuing of wildly different parts, a wild awakened property is born, inconsistent and lacking a few of the benefits of other awakened properties.

### Path: Might
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional damage. Each time you deal damage, roll 1d6: On a 1, the weapon deals acid damage. On a 2, it deals cold damage. On a 3, it deals electricity damage. On a 4, it deals fire damage. On a 5, it deals negative damage. Finally, on a 6, it deals sonic damage
*   **6th** The additional damage increases to 1d4
*   **8th** The additional damage increases to 1d6
*   **12th** The damage dealt by this awakened property ignores resistances
*   **18th** The additional damage increases to 1d8
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional damage, the target gains weakness 1 to that damage type until the beginning of your next turn
