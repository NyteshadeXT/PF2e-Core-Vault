# Weapon Awakening: Bane
[[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/magical|Magical]]

**Parts** The monster must be of the same type as the type you chose for bane, or at the GM's discretion, of a type anathematic to the type you chose for bane, such as using celestial parts to make a weapon bane against fiends.
**Effect** You awaken the weapon with energies spawned by your previous defeat of the creatures whose parts reside within it, or from energies anathematic to a certain type of creature, in order to make the weapon particularly effective against a specific type of creature. When you create a bane weapon, choose aberration, animal, astral, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, dream, elemental, ethereal, fey, fiend, giant, monitor, negative, ooze, positive, spirit, time, or both fungus and plant. Hereafter, this entry refers to the type of creature you chose as the weapon's "bane type".

### Path: Might
*   **2nd** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional damage of the weapon's base damage type to creatures of the bane type
*   **4th** The additional damage against the bane type increases to 1d4
*   **6th** The additional damage against the bane type increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you sap the strength of a creature from the bane type, causing it to be [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn
*   **10th** Against a creature of the bane type, the weapon's base damage ignores the first 5 points of the target's resistance
*   **14th** The weapon can outright slay creatures of its bane type. On a critical hit, instead of being [[enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn, a creature of the weapon's bane type must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, it's [[enfeebled 1]] until the end of your next turn, on a success, it's [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of your next turn, on a failure, it's [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] until the end of your next turn, and on a critical failure, it's destroyed. This effect has the incapacitation trait
*   **16th** The additional damage against creatures of the bane type increases to 1d8
*   **20th** The additional damage against creatures of the bane type increases to 1d10

### Path: Technique
*   **2nd** Strikes with the weapon cause external or internal bleeding in creatures of the weapon's bane type. Against such creatures, Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent bleed damage
*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional damage of the weapon's base damage type to creatures of the weapon's bane type
*   **6th** The persistent bleed damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you sap the strength of a creature of the bane type, causing it to be enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn
*   **10th** Against a creature of the bane type, the weapon's base damage ignores the first 5 points of the target's resistance and the persistent bleed damage from this property ignores the target's resistance
*   **12th** The persistent bleed damage on a hit against a creature of the bane type increases to 1d8
*   **14th** The weapon can outright slay creatures of its bane type. On a critical hit, a creature of the bane type is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next turn. It must also attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, it's enfeebled 3 until the end of your next turn instead of enfeebled 2, and on a critical failure, it's destroyed. This effect has the incapacitation trait
*   **16th** The persistent bleed damage on a hit against a creature of the bane type increases to 1d10
*   **20th** The blood loss continues to sap strength from creatures of the weapon's bane type. The enfeebled condition from a critical hit lasts as long as the persistent bleed damage lasts, or until the end of your next turn, whichever is longer
