# Synthesizing
![[3_the_pcs_synthesizing_and_turning_those_monster_parts_into_raw_materials_rgb.webp]]

The first step in creating an item out of monster parts is synthesizing the item. At its most basic level, synthesizing monster parts into an item allows you to create a mundane weapon, armor, or shield out of those parts, as well as the basis for an item that will become a Perception item or skill item, like goggles or an anklet. This costs the normal amount for an item of that type. For instance, it would take 1 gp worth of parts to make a longsword, so you could slay a bulette and build a longsword out of its claws with plenty of materials to spare.

Beyond the basics, synthesizing upgrades an item's basic functionality and allows the item to be awakened with additional powers (See [[Awakening|Awakening]]). To synthesize an item, you first gather monster parts that meet the requirements listed in the item's synthesizing entry and combine them into the item. You can't use this process on an item made from a particular material, since you're building and synthesizing it out of monster parts, and you can't use this process on a magic item. A synthesized shield normally uses the statistics for a steel shield. Because items synthesized out of monster parts usually aren't metal, it bypasses a druid's restriction against wearing metal armor and shields, which offers a small but noticeable improvement for druids' survivability. If your group wishes to maintain the status quo for druids instead, limit druids to a base armor that wouldn't contain metal, and have their shields use the Hardness, HP, and BT thresholds listed for bucklers.

Itâ€™s recommended that GMs allow characters to assign monster parts to synthesize or awaken items as soon as they collect the monster parts, and then gain the benefits of synthesizing or awakening during their next daily preparations without waiting to spend downtime. This keeps things simpler and allows for fast-paced games with plenty of monster part upgrades, and prevents the party from needing to track exactly which monster dropped which parts in what quantities over time.

If the GM prefers, it can be part of the Craft activity using downtime instead. This choice makes a big difference in the value of Crafting in your game. For groups using the Craft activity, Crafting could become mandatory for multiple characters in the group to max out. By contrast, for groups using synthesis during daily preparations, particularly those using the Full variant, Crafting is less valuable than it is in a normal game. Discuss with your group and make the decision that works best for the story and pacing you want to tell.

If your party doesn't decide to use the monster parts right after gathering, it's good practice to record the type of monster the parts came from and their value (such as 45 gp worth of elite mimic parts). Later when you wish to synthesize or awaken a part that requires a specific type of monster ability, you can always reference the monster to ensure the monster parts can be used for your item.

While there's no need to keep track of every monster that provided the parts you used to synthesize your items, you might want to consider noting particular powerful or memorable monsters whose parts you include in an item by changing the item's name to incorporate the monster's name, typically appended at the end. For instance, if you incorporated jabberwock parts in your greatsword, you might add "of the jabberwock" to the end of the item's name, or if you incorporated ancient red dragon parts, you might add "of the crimson wyrm."

## Synthesizing Details
The five main categories of items you can synthesize are weapons, armor, shields, Perception items, and skill items. You can synthesize an item with monster parts, causing the item to increase in value. Synthesized items level up when the total value of monster parts used to synthesize them reaches set thresholds, and as you keep synthesizing and leveling up your items, they grant additional benefits. Use [[Table 3A_ Synthesis Costs by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)|Table 3A: Synthesis Costs by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)]]} and [[Tables - Synthesis Cost by Item Level|Table 3B: Synthesis Cost by Item Level (Shields]] to determine the total value of monster parts needed to level up your items. Tables 4A through 4E list the benefits each type of item grants based upon its level. In addition to these specific benefits, increasing an item's level also increases your options when awakening the item. You can't synthesize an item to a level above your character's level, but you can synthesize additional monster parts to an item to increase its value towards the next level. If you synthesize enough parts into an item in which your character level is the only limitation preventing it from leveling up, the item levels up as soon as your character does.

## Salvaging and Transferring
![[modules/battlezoo-bestiary-su-pf2e/art/Equipment/beast_hammer.webp]]

Sometimes you'll come across synthesized items during your travels. When you do, you typically have a decision to make: do you salvage the item, or decide to keep it and synthesize it further. Salvaging an item deconstructs the item into monster parts that can be used for synthesizing or awakening. However, salvaging can retrieve parts worth at most 50% of the cost of the item's synthesis and awakened properties, similarly to selling an item but without the need to return to town and find a shop to use as an intermediary. For example, an axe with 100 gp of parts spent to synthesize it and 100 gp of parts spent to awaken a fire property has a total cost of 200 gp of parts. Salvaging would recover 100 gp of parts, 50 from each. These salvaged parts can be used for synthesis or awakening as normal.

On the other hand, you might find an item and want to keep its synthesis and awakened properties but transfer to another item of the same type. For instance, a rogue might find a greatsword but want to transfer the synthesis and awaken properties to a shortsword. To transfer the synthesis value or an awakened property from one item of the same type (weapon, armor, shield, Perception item, or skill item) to another with lower value, first choose what to swap, either the synthesis value or the value of one of the awakened properties. In order to successfully transfer synthesis value, the two items must have compatible requirements for the type of monster parts they need. For instance, you couldn't transfer synthesis from a bludgeoning weapon to a slashing weapon because they have different requirements. To perform the transfer, you'll need to provide additional monster parts worth 10% of the difference in values between the two. Finally, you swap the synthesis or awakened property value between the two items.

For our example rogue, if they had a _+1 striking cold might (4) rapier (6)_ with a synthesis value of 250 gp and an _awakened cold property (4)_ with a value of 100 gp, and they wanted to transfer the synthesis from a _+2 striking greatsword (10)_ with a synthesis value of 1,000 gp to the rapier, and keep the rapier's awaken property, they would calculate the difference in synthesis value (1,000 gp - 250 gp = 750 gp), divide by 10 (for the additional 10%) to then provide 75 gp worth of monster parts to perform the transfer. With the transfer complete, the rapier would become a _+2 striking cold might (4) rapier (10)_ and have a synthesis value of 1,000 gp and the greatsword would become a _+1 striking greatsword (6)_ would have a synthesis value of 250 gp.

On the other hand, if the barbarian insisted that instead of transferring the synthesis value to the rapier, the group should transfer the cold awakened property onto the greatsword, the transfer would require 10 gp of parts (100 gp for the cold awakened property - 0 gp for the greatsword, divided by 10).

### Synthesizing and Awakening Vs Runes
An item is either built and upgraded using this system or the normal rules for magic items with precious materials, fundamental runes, and property runes. Even in the light or hybrid versions, where magic weapons and armor using fundamental runes and property runes still exist, a single item can't use both at once.

## Synthesizing Weapons
![Beast axe](modules/battlezoo-bestiary-su-pf2e/art/Equipment/beast_axe.webp) 

To synthesize a weapon (or _handwraps of mighty blows_), you need monster parts from a monster with an unarmed attack that matches the weapon's physical damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). If a weapon has the versatile or modular traits, you can use monster parts from monsters with unarmed attacks matching any of the weapon's different damage types. Synthesizing a weapon grants the following benefits, as shown on [[Tables - Synthesis Benefits by Level|Table 4A: Synthesis Benefits by Level (Weapon)]]}.

**Item Bonus to Attack Rolls** The weapon grants you the listed item bonus to attack rolls.

**Awakening** You can awaken the weapon up to the listed number of times (see [[Awakening|Awakening]]).

**Additional Damage Dice** The weapon's damage dice increase to the listed amount of weapon damage dice. The italicized name is the equivalent fundamental rune, and you can use it as part of the weapon's name to make it more recognizable to a group used to the core magic item system (i.e. +2 greater striking longsword (12)).

## Synthesizing Armor
![Beast armor](modules/battlezoo-bestiary-su-pf2e/art/Equipment/beast_armor.webp)

You can use monster parts to synthesize a suit of armor or explorer's clothing. The monster must have suitable materials: hairs, fibers, or silk for explorer's clothing and padded armor, skin for leather and hide armors, or some sort of hard components like bones or horns for armor typically made of metal. Monsters lacking any sort of armored component, such as oozes, do not provide suitable components. Synthesizing a suit of armor grants the following benefits, as shown on [[Table 4B_Synthesis Benefits by Level (Amor)|Table 4B: Synthesis Benefits by Level (Amor)]]. Just like magic armor created using the normal rules, synthesized armor has the invested trait.

**Increased Item Bonus to AC** The armor increases its item bonus to AC by the listed amount.

**Awakening** You can awaken the armor up to the listed number of times (see [[Awakening|Awakening]]).

**Item Bonus to Saving Throws** The armor grants the listed item bonus to all saving throws. The italicized name is the equivalent fundamental rune, and you can use it as part of the armor's name to make it more recognizable to a group used to the core magic item system (i.e. _+3 greater resilient leather armor (19))_.

## Synthesizing Shields

You can typically use monster parts to synthesize a shield if the monster has Hardness, resistance to physical damage, or resistance to one of the three physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). In some cases, you and the GM might decide together that a monster with resistance to physical damage because it is amorphous or gaseous doesn't provide appropriate parts to synthesize a shield. Synthesizing a shield grants the following benefits as shown on [[Table 4C_Synthesis Benefits by Level (Shield)|Table 4C: Synthesis Benefits by Level (Shield)]]. When synthesizing a buckler, reduce the listed Hardness by 2, HP by 12, and BT by 6. You can't synthesize a tower shield in this way.

**Hardness** The shield has the listed Hardness.

**HP** The shield has the listed number of Hit Points.

**BT** The shield has the listed Break Threshold.

**Awakening** You can awaken the shield once, starting at level 4 (see [[Awakening|Awakening]]).

## Synthesizing Perception Items

Perception items are worn magic items that enhance Perception, and you can synthesize them out of monsters with special senses. You can use monster parts to synthesize a Perception item if the monster has a special sense in its stat block other than low-light vision. Synthesizing a Perception item grants the following benefits, as shown on [[Table 4D_Synthesis Benefits by Level (Perception Item)|Table 4D: Synthesis Benefits by Level (Perception Item)]]. Perception items are worn items, and just like worn items created using the normal rules, synthesized Perception items have the invested trait.

**Item Bonus to Perception** The item grants the listed item bonus to Perception checks.

**Awakening** You can awaken the Perception item once, starting at level 3 (see [[Awakening|Awakening]]).

## Synthesizing Skill Items

Skill items refer to a category of worn magic items that enhance a specific skill, and you can synthesize them out of monsters good at that skill. You can use monster parts to synthesize a skill item if the monster has the skill listed in its stat block. Synthesizing a skill item grants the following benefits, as shown on [[Table 4E_ Synthesis Benefits by Level (Skill Item)|Table 4E: Synthesis Benefits by Level (Skill Item)]]. Skill items are worn items, and just like worn items created using the normal rules, synthesis skill items have the invested trait.

**Item Bonus to Skill** The item grants the listed item bonus to skill checks with its associated skill.

**Awakening** You can awaken the skill item once, starting at level 3 (see [[Awakening|Awakening]]).

## Synthesizing Staves

Just like any other kind of item from the base crafting system, you can choose to build a magic staff normally using synthesis as a single-step process by simply paying the material cost for the base item. However, if your group uses the rules for personal staves from _Pathfinder Secrets of Magic_, you can also synthesize a personal staff incrementally using the monster part system. Synthesizing staves uses the same costs as weapons and armor, but staves are a little different. They can't accept awakened properties, but they can be synthesized as weapons in addition to being synthesized as staves. Doing so gives them two different item levels, one as a weapon and one as a staff, and they use these item levels separately to determine any necessary DCs and other statistics. The level-by-level benefits of synthesizing a staff are summarized on [[Table 4F_ Synthesis Benefits By Level (Staff)]]. Any time the table lists a number of spells, the staff gains that many spells, all of which must share a single trait that isn't too broad to use (such as incapacitation, spell schools, or traditions).

**Spells** The staff gains the listed number of spells at the listed spell level.

**Awakening** You can't Awaken the staff, but you can synthesize it as a weapon.

## Example of Synthesizing

The party's level 7 fighter recently lost their favorite weapon, and so they want to synthesize an amazing longsword out of the teeth of the tyrannosaurus they just defeated. They're playing using the hybrid variant and have 275 gp of tyrannosaurus parts. Although a tyrannosaurus doesn't have a slashing attack, longswords have the versatile piercing trait, which means the fighter can use the teeth to synthesize their longsword. They start the synthesized by building the tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (0) for 1 gp, and then put the remaining 274 gp into the longsword's synthesized. Next, they synthesize the sword and spend 250 gp, which means the fighter has synthesized the longsword to item level 6, and it gains the appropriate benefits: a +1 item bonus to hit, a second weapon damage die, and the ability to awaken an awakened property. The sword is now a _+1 striking longsword (6)_, with 24 gp of monster parts remaining. Finally, the fighter decides they want their longsword to reach level 7 as quickly as possible, so they apply the remaining 24 gp of monster parts to the longsword, which makes the final weapon a _+1 striking longsword (6)_ synthesized to 274 gp-just 86 gp more of parts for the longsword to reach 7th level!

In addition, the fighter is particularly excited about that awakened property, as the group also recently defeated 2 magma scorpions and now they have fiery plans for what comes next for their _+1 striking tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (6)_ (to see the fighter's next steps, check out [[Awakening#Example of Awakening|Example of Awakening]]).
