# Variant: Relic Imbuing
Relic aspects and gifts, originally created to support relics in the _Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide_, are a natural fit for crafting with monster parts. Is the weapon refined with parts from aquatic and water monsters on one side and fiends on the other? That could lend itself well to a relic with the fiend and water aspects. In general, relics keep the refining process but replace imbuing for an item, using the relic rules to grant gifts instead. If you're interested in mixing and matching, you might consider creating imbued properties based on relic gifts or relic gifts based on imbued properties!
