# Awakening
![[5_the_pcs_adding_magic_to_those_parts.webp|left|500]]

Once you've synthesized an item to a high enough level, you unlock the ability to awaken the item. The necessary level to unlock awakening varies from item to item; see Tables 4A through 4E for more details. Awakening an item follows a similar process as synthesizing: add monster parts that meet the requirements for the awakened property you want to add to the item. You can't use monster parts if they do not meet the requirements for the awakened property.

For example, if you are awakening a cold property, you can't use parts from a monster that doesn't have any cold abilities. Track this value separately from the monster parts you use to synthesize the item, and if the item is high enough level and of the right type to be awakened multiple times, track the value for each awakened property separately. Continue adding value to the awakened property as you use more parts to awaken the property, just like with synthesizing.

When you reach the values specified in [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Table 5A: Awakening Cost by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)|Table 5A: Awakening Cost by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)]]} (if awakening a weapon or suit of armor) or [[Journals/Monster Parts Subsystem/Table 5B: Awakening Costs by Item Level (Shields, Perception Items, and Skill Items)|Table 5B: Awakening Costs by Item Level (Shields, Perception Items, and Skill Items)]] (if awakening a shield, Perception item, or skill item), the awakened property levels up, potentially granting increased benefits to the item. Just like with synthesizing, the value and benefits are cumulative, and you can keep adding value to increase the awakened property's level further and gain more benefits. An awakened property's level can never be higher than the item's level or your level, whichever is lower. Much like in synthesizing, you can keep contributing monster parts and awakening the property past that point, and in that case, the awakened property's level increases immediately once you synthesize the item enough to increase the item's synthesizing level. Unlike synthesizing, which only has a single option depending on the type of item, you can choose from several options when you awaken an item, and some of them have multiple upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your item to match your personal playstyle.

## Awakened Properties
The following awakened properties are available when awakening items with different kinds of monster parts. Sometimes an awakened property lists that the item gains either a specific spell, or a chosen spell that follows certain criteria. In this case, the item gains a command and Interact activation the same number of actions as the listed spell, with an effect of casting the listed spell. The item's DC for any effects is based on its item level, using the value from the Magic Item DCs table, found in the _Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide_. If the item needs to make a spell attack roll or counteract check, its modifier is equal to its DC - 10.

Some awakened properties, especially for weapons, have multiple upgrade paths, reflecting the different ways you can adjust the awakening process. These paths are magic (emphasizing thematic spells), might (emphasizing direct damage), and technique (emphasizing special effects and damage over time). If the weapon is capable of holding multiple awakened properties, you can apply the same awakened property to the weapon multiple times as long as you choose a different path each time.

To use an activated ability of an awakened property on a held item, such as a weapon, you must be wielding the item. Any effects are cumulative. For instance, if you wanted to make the ultimate fire sword, you could awaken the sword with fire from each of the magic, might, and technique paths. You would combine the fire damage and persistent fire damage from all three paths to determine the weapon's total effects, meaning you would eventually deal 5d10 fire damage on a critical hit!

## Example of Awakening
The party's level 7 fighter just synthesized a level 6 longsword out of tyrannosaurus parts (see [[Synthesizing#Example of Synthesizing|Example of Synthesizing]]). Realizing they could also awaken a property, they decided the only thing better than a tyrannosaurus tooth longsword is one that's on fire! Fortunately, the group recently defeated 2 magma scorpions, gaining 280 gp worth of parts. Since the magma scorpions have the fire trait or an attack or spell that deals fire damage (they have both!), the fighter awakens all the parts into their longsword, choosing to awaken the property of fire. The fighter has three choices of path for this awakened property and chooses the path of might. Awakening 250 gp of parts increases the awakened property's level to 6 (the current maximum, since the item level of the longsword is 6), and lights the tyrannosaurus tooth longsword aflame, allowing it to deal 1d4 additional fire damage! The final weapon is a _+1 striking fire might (6) tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (6)_ synthesized to 274 gp!
