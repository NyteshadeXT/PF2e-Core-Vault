# Variant: Precious Materials and Refining
Normally a refined item is made out of various monster parts, and so it can't be made out of a precious item. However, it's possible that you might have a situation where you want to mimic the rules of a special material, perhaps for an item made entirely out of dragon scales, or for something made of extremely light monster parts that mimic the effects of mithral. In this case, choose which types of monsters provide parts that can create a special material item, for instance, dragons are a natural choice for the effects of dragonhide. A character can contribute monster parts towards the special material's effects in the same way as refining monster parts into a mundane item. Just like normal for items made out of precious materials, a low-grade precious material item can only be refined up to level 8, and a standard- grade precious material item can be refined up to level 15. A character can improve the grade of a precious material item from low to standard to high by providing an appropriate monster equal to the difference in price.

Using a suit of dragonhide full plate as an example, a character could use 2,240 gp of dragon parts to create a standard-grade suit of dragonhide full plate. Later, to increase to a high-grade suit of dragonhide full plate, they would need to use a total of 44,800 gp of dragon parts. Since they already have a suit of standard-grade dragonhide full plate, they'd need to find 42,560 gp more dragon parts to do so.
