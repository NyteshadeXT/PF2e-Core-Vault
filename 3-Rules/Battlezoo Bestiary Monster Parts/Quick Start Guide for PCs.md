# Quick Start Guide for PCs
_If your character is using the Monster Parts system from this book, you can use the following steps to create awesome items for yourself and your teammates out of monster parts._

# Step 1: Slay Monsters

This part works like normal. Normally, you need to kill monsters before you can harvest their parts, though if your group is more peaceful, you might be able to find monster parts as quest rewards, or even unlock the powerful magical effects of monster parts freely given.

# Step 2: Gather Ingredients

Next, you gather ingredients from the monsters you defeated. The GM will tell you how much value the monster parts have, as well as their Bulk. To prevent you from having to carry a lot of materials and keep track of them all, you might want to consider using them right away, but if not, you can hold onto them as long as you want. For more information, see [[Gathering Ingredients|Gathering Ingredients]]. If you have plenty of downtime, you can try to get more total value of monster parts from a monster's corpse. For more information, see [[Gathering Ingredients#Gathering More from Monsters|Gathering More from Monsters]].

# Step 3: Synthesize Item

Synthesizing an item with monster parts is the first step towards creating an awesome custom item with the parts you've found. During this step, you can either create the base mundane item from scratch by providing monster parts equal to its Price, or you can start with an existing mundane item. Once you've chosen the item, synthesize it to make it more powerful, using as many monster parts as you like, as long as they meet the item's synthesizing requirements. For instance, you can synthesize a sword out of parts from a monster that had slashing or piercing unarmed attacks. As you reach certain threshold values while synthesizing, your item will level up, increasing its item level and potentially gaining more benefits. You can't synthesize an item higher than your own level. For more information, see [[Synthesizing|Synthesizing]], and for an example, see [[Synthesizing#Example of Synthesizing|Example of Synthesizing]].

# Step 4: Awaken Item

Awakening an item is where the item starts getting really interesting. As you continue to synthesize your item, the item eventually gains capacity to be awakened with special awakened properties. A few types of items can even eventually be awakened multiple times. Just like synthesizing, you can awaken an item by using monster parts that meet the awakened property's requirements. For instance, if you want to awaken an item with fire, you'll need parts from a fire monster or a monster with fire abilities. Just like with synthesizing, as you reach certain thresholds, the awakened property will level up, potentially granting increased benefits. You can't awaken a property on an item to be higher level than the item's own level. For more information, see [[Awakening|Awakening]], and for an example, see [[Awakening#Example of Awakening|Example of Awakening]].
