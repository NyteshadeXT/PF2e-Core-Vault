# Quick Start Guide for GMs
_If you're a GM and you want to start using the Monster Parts system from this book, you can use the following steps to get your group started in no time!_

# Step 1: Choose a Variant

To ensure that this system works great for any group that wants to upgrade items with monster parts, the system includes three variants that vary depending on how heavily your group relies on this system compared to the magic item system in the _Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook_. Start by talking to your players to gauge interest and choosing the variant that's right for you. For more information, see [[The Three Variants|The Three variants]].

# Step 2: Determine Monster Parts as Treasure

Once you know which variant you're using, you can start giving your PCs monster parts as treasure. It's most accurate to use [[Tables - Light Variant|Table 1A: Party Treasure by Level (Light Variant)]], [[Tables - Hybrid Variant|Table 1B: Party Treasure by Level (Hybrid Variant)]], or [[Tables - Full Variant|Table 1C: Party Treasure by Level (Full Variant)]] (depending on which variant you choose) to plan out monster part drops per level. You can also use [[Table 2A_ Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Light Variant)|Table 2A: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Light Variant)]], [[Table 2B_ Monster Parts gained Per Monster (Hybrid Variant)|Table 2B: Monster Parts gained Per Monster (Hybrid Variant)]], or [[Table 2C_ Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Full Variant)|Table 2C: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Full Variant)]] to determine the value of parts that a given monster grants the PCs; this method is much more flexible, perfect for a sandbox campaign, but depending on if the group fights mostly single strong monsters or many weak monsters, it might distort wealth over time. Thus, you might want to occasionally keep an eye out to be sure the PCs don't have too much or too little. For more information, see [[Gathering Ingredients|Gathering Ingredients]].

# Step 3: Communicate With Your Players

Ask your players what sorts of items and awakened properties they want to create, and you can use that to help them guide the story towards opponents that meet the necessary requirements. For instance, if one of the PCs is interested in creating a weapon awakened with electricity, you could give them a rumor when they Gather Information about a dungeon haunted by electric monsters. If you want to see the requirements for synthesizing and awakening for yourself, you can check out [[Synthesizing|Synthesizing]] and [[Awakening|Awakening]].

# Step 4: Play the Game

Now all that's left is to play the game with the new system! As the PCs defeat monsters, the players will have their characters make decisions about how to use the parts they've found to upgrade their items. All you have to do is keep giving them more parts, using the appropriate tables to do so, and they'll do the rest. Continue to keep in mind what sorts of synthesizing and awakening your PCs are interested in pursuing so that you can make sure they have a chance to find the right sorts of monsters to accomplish their goals.
