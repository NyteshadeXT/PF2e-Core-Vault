# Wormhunter

**Uncommon** â€¢ **Archetype** â€¢ **Divine** â€¢ **Void** â€¢ **Mental**

> _You have survived the touch of the Worm and emerged scarredâ€”but not broken. Where others see only rot and despair, you perceive patterns of entropy, whispers of the vast intelligence that spawned the undying horrors of Kyuss. You channel this taint into strength, wielding corruption as both weapon and shield._

### **Wormhunter Dedication**â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ

**Feat 4**  
**Archetype**, **Dedication**, **Divine**, **Void**, **Mental**

**Prerequisites** You must have survived direct exposure to a _Kyuss worm_, _wormspawn_, or similar parasitic undead corruption.  
**Access** Granted automatically to followers of the _Age of Worms_, _Apostolic Scrolls_, or any campaign tied to the Worm or its echoes.

---

**Effect**  
You bear the _Wormscar_â€”a psychic and physical mark that forever connects you to the Void.  
You gain the following benefits:

- You gain a **+2 circumstance bonus** to **Recall Knowledge** checks about undead or parasitic creatures.
    
- You are **immune to disease** and gain a **+1 status bonus** to saving throws against **poison** and **mental** effects.
    
- You gain the **Kyussbane** ability below.
    

> #### **Kyussbane**â€‚([[Divine]], [[Void]], [[Wormhunter]])
> 
> Your strikes are infused with the paradoxical purity of entropy. You deal **+1 Void damage per weapon die** against creatures with the [[Undead]] or [[Parasite]] traits, or those specifically tied to Kyuss or similar worm-based corruption.
> 
> When you critically hit a creature with regeneration or vitality-based healing granted by a Void effect, that regeneration is **suppressed for 1 round**.

You can take Wormhunter archetype feats.  
**Special** You canâ€™t select another archetypeâ€™s Dedication feat until youâ€™ve gained at least two other Wormhunter feats.

### **Wormscarred Insight**

**Feat 6**  
**Archetype**, **Divine**, **Void**, **Mental**

The scars whisper of the unseen. When you still your mind, you can sense the pulse of Kyussâ€™s corruption in the air.

You gain the **Detect Minion** focus cantrip.

> #### **Detect Minion**â€‚([[Divine]], [[Detection]], [[Void]])
> 
> **Cast** ðŸ”¹ (concentrate)  
> **Range** 30 feet; **Area** 30-foot emanation
> 
> You detect the presence of entities corrupted by the Wormâ€”undead, parasitic hosts, or creatures bearing Void essence from Kyuss. This functions as _Detect Undead_, but it only detects creatures or objects tied to Kyuss or parasitic corruption.
> 
> **Heightened (+1)** The emanation increases by 10 feet.

You gain a **focus pool of 1 Focus Point**. If you already have a focus pool, increase its size by 1.  
You can Refocus by meditating on the whispers of the Worm, replaying fragmented memories of your infection.

### **Gift of the Worm**

**Feat 8**  
**Archetype**, **Divine**, **Void**, **Mental**

You deliberately commune with the Wormâ€”either by consuming a dormant Kyuss worm or through meditation upon the Apostolic Scrolls.  
You gain one of the following **Gifts of the Worm**, but must also accept a corresponding **Madness Scar** (a permanent mental quirk).

You can take **Gift of the Worm** up to **three times**, choosing a different Gift and Madness Scar each time.

---

#### **Gifts of the Worm**

|Gift|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Wormâ€™s Resilience**|You gain **resistance 5 to Void damage** and a **+1 status bonus to saves** against effects with the [[Void]] or [[Undead]] traits. This increases to resistance 10 and a +2 bonus at 15th level.|
|**Wormâ€™s Clarity**|Once per day, when you fail a saving throw against a **mental** or **possession** effect, you can reroll the save with a +1 circumstance bonus. You must take the new result.|
|**Wormâ€™s Hunger**|When you reduce an undead or parasite creature to 0 HP, you gain **10 temporary Hit Points** that last for 1 minute.|
|**Wormâ€™s Whisper**|You gain _Speak with Dead_ as a **divine innate spell** once per day. When used on a living creature infected with worms or parasites, it instead functions as _Read Thoughts_ (DC equals your class DC).|

#### **Madness Scars**

Each Gift leaves a psychic wound. Choose one each time you gain a Gift.

| Madness Scar             | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |

| **Worm Paranoia**        | Whenever you fail a saving throw against a **Void**, **Undead**, or **curse** effect, you become **[[Frightened 1]]** for 1 round (this condition value canâ€™t increase from this effect). |
| **The Crawling Truth**   | You take a **â€“1 status penalty to saving throws against confusion, possession, or uncontrolled transformation effects** (such as polymorphs that warp your body).                         |

These afflictions are permanent until removed by divine intervention, miracle, or narrative purification (GM discretion).

Youâ€™ve mastered the paradox of the Worm: enlightenment through decay.  
You gain the following benefits:

- You gain a **+2 status bonus to damage rolls and spell DCs** against **undead, parasites**, or **Void-touched creatures**.
    
- Once per day, when you critically succeed at a **Recall Knowledge** check about an undead, parasite, or aberration, you can ask the GM **one additional hidden question** beyond what a critical success would normally reveal.
    

> The answer manifests as a flash of alien insight or whispered revelation in the voice of the Worm.
