description: "This healer's toolkit contains a seemingly endless supply of bandages, herbs, and healing items of impeccable quality, granting you a +2 item bonus to Medicine checks.  If you use the _marvelous medicines_ when you [[Actions/Treat Poison|Treat Poison]] or [[Actions/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]], before you roll your check, the medicines attempt to counteract the poison or disease you're treating, with a counteract rank of 5 and a counteract modifier of +21. This is a healing effect.  The medicines can't be used to treat the same affliction for that patient again"
