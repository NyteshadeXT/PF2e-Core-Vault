description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  * * *  This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. When activated, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. For 1 minute, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] creatures. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to creatures that are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 Flat check to target a hidden creature. While you're adjacent to an undetected creature of your level or lower, it's instead only hidden from you.  If you have the [[Feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]] feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be undetected by you because you can't see them hidden instead.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Mummified Bat|Effect: Mummified Bat]]"
