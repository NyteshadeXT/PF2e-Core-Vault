description: "This snare is often used to mark intruders for later tracking or identification. When you create this snare, you must decide whether to make it a dye or a scent marker. Either type of marking grants a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Track|Track]] the creature for up to 24 hours or until the dye or scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water and 10 minutes of scrubbing). A creature that enters a square of the snare must attempt a DC 17 Reflex check save.  * * *  **Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Failure** The snare marks the creature.  **Critical Failure** The snare marks the creature, and the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn."
