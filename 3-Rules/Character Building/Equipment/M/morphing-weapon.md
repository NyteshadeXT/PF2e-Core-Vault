description: "In its base form, this armament looks like a smooth bar of soft, gleaming metal shaped like a horseshoe. Its ability to adjust to any battle situation makes it a popular weapon for elite warriors of the Plane of Metal. It can be shaped into a melee weapon using its shifting rune, but it can shift only into weapons primarily made of metal or back to its base shape. In weapon form, it's a _+1 striking shifting_ weapon.  **Activate**â€”Reshape `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per 10 minutes  * * *  **Effect** Strike with the morphing weapon, choosing one of the following benefits to apply to the Strike.  **Reach** Increase the reach by 5 feet.  **Shift** The weapon's damage becomes your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing instead of its normal type.  **Take** If the Strike hits, you can attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] from your target immediately after as a reaction.  **Weigh** Gain a status bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice."
