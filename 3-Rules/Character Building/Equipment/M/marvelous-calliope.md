description: "This large slide whistle appears to be made of fine brass, the sides of which are engraved with musical notes and dancing clowns.  * * *  **Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact)  **Effect** You blow a tune upon the slide whistle, causing the whistle to expand. The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard. By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.  You have a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.  If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the _marvelous calliope_, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You play the calliope, causing it to cast [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] on one of the listeners."
