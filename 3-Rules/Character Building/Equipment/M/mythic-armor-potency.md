description: "This armor is etched with a mythical ward providing unparalleled defense. Increase the armor's item bonus to AC by 4, and the armor can be etched with four property runes.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Survive Devastation** `pf2:r` (concentration)  **Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds against you with a weapon or unarmed Strike  **Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; if the triggering Strike was made by a mythic creature, it's a normal success instead. If it was made by a non-mythic creature, it's a failure.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** _Mythic armor potency_ runes can only be crafted, etched, or transferred by a mythic character capable of making a Crafting check at mythic proficiency (such as by having the Artisan's Calling)."
