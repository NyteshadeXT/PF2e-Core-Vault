description: "Elegant jewelry such as the _master magus ring_ adorns experienced magi. Each ring has a significant metal and symbol to represent a particular hybrid study, such as a heavy iron ring with an icon of a mountain for [[Class Features/Inexorable Iron|Inexorable Iron]], or glittering silver with a shield-like emblem for [[Class Features/Sparkling Targe|Sparkling Targe]]. You gain a +2 item bonus to Arcana checks.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a magus conflux spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` command  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The ring transports you and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space you can see within a range equal to your Speed. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the activation fails and is used.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You are a magus."
