description: "A _mask of the cursed eye_ is decorated with at least one wide, staring eye. The first time each day a creature on your plane that you can't perceive targets you with a divination spell, the creature must attempt a DC 24 Will check save. This effect is automatic and does not require you to Activate the item.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is unaffected. You know you've been targeted with a divination spell, but the mask gives you no additional information.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute. You know you've been targeted with a divination spell, but the mask gives you no additional information.  **Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and dazzled for 10 minutes, and the spell is disrupted. You gain a brief mental glimpse of the triggering creature and learn its approximate distance and direction."
