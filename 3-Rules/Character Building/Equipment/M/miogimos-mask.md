description: "The crime lord Miogimo almost always appears with this special mask, crafted with a piece of his soul.  It has two forms. In its first form, the mask depicts a silvery and angelic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as lawful good to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. In its second form, the mask depicts a gold-skinned demonic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as chaotic evil to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. If you die while wearing the mask, a fragment of your soul is trapped in the mask, forming a life link. If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a Will check save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment. If you succeed, your soul fragment replaces the old one. On a failure, you die normally.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  * * *  **Effect** You switch the mask to its other form.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Crisis of Faith|Crisis of Faith]] (DC 34 Will check), targeting up to four creatures within 30 feet. If the mask is in its angelic form, you can target only evil and neutral creatures. If the mask is in its demonic form, you can target only good and neutral creatures.  * * *  **Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact)  **Requirements** A soul fragment is in the mask  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Talking Corpse|Talking Corpse]] on the soul fragment, except you communicate telepathically and don't require the fragment's body to speak."
