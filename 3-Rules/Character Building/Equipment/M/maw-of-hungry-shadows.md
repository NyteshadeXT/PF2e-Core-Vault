description: "Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the shadow trait  * * *  **Effect** Your shadow, and that of the tome, elongates and reaches hungrily for one foe within 30 feet, who must attempt a Fortitude save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] as the shadows scrape across it.  **Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] as the shadows seize it.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the shadows also pull the creature into the tome, teleporting it to the Shadow Plane."
