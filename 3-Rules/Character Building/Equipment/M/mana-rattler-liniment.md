description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  According to reports, as well as Emelett's own marketing pitches, this lotion is derived from rare mana rattlesnakes whose oils ward against poison and disease. When applied, you can attempt to counteract a poison or disease effect currently afflicting you. The potion has a counteract rank of 5 and a +15 modifier for the roll. You also acquire a serpentine appearance, growing fangs and scaly skin. For 1 hour, you gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage plus 1 poison damage.
