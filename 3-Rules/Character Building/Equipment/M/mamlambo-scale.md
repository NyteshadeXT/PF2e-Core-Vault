description: "The faint glow beneath the thick, algae-green scales of this suit of _+1 resilient scale mail_ hints at the armor's source.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Luminous Lure** `pf2:1` (concentrate, light, manipulate, mental, visual)  **Frequency** Once per day  **Effect** The _mamlambo scale_ sheds dim light in a 20-foot emanation. The light has a duration of 1 minute, but you can extinguish the light with an Interact action. A creature that begins its turn in the light must attempt a DC 26 Will check save. Regardless of the save's result, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Luminous Lure|Effect: Luminous Lure]]  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], and for as long as it remains in the light, it must spend at least 1 of its actions on each of its turns to move closer to the source of the light. If the creature ends its movement adjacent to you, it is slowed 1 until it is out of the light or until you make a Strike against it.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the first Strike you make against it while it is slowed.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the scales and hide of a mamlambo."
