description: "**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact, Strike  * * *  Elegant silver filigree contains the body of this ephemeral item, which is made of solid light. Its shape resembles a pistol, and it's often carried by hunters of werecreatures, vampires, and devils. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun's damage is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn. If it has a weakness to silver or a resistance that can be bypassed by silver, it's also [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute.  **Success** The target takes full damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.  The damage is 1d8 fire damage at night, or 1d6 fire damage at other times."
