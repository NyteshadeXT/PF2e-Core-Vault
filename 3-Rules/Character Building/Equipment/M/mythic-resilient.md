description: "_Mythic resilient_ runes imbue armor with unrivaled protection from a wide array of effects. The armor grants a +4 item bonus to saving throws to the wearer.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Defy Obliteration** `pf2:r` (concentration)  **Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw  **Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; if the triggering save was made due to an effect created by a mythic monster, hazard, or other effect, it's a normal failure instead. If the save was made due to an effect that wasn't mythic, it becomes a success.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** _Mythic resilient_ runes can only be crafted, etched, or transferred by a mythic character capable of making a Crafting check at mythic proficiency (such as by having the Artisan's Calling)."
