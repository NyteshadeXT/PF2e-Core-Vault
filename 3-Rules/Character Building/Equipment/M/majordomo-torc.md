description: "**Perception** +13; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet  **Communication** speech (Common and 1 imparted language)  **Skills** Diplomacy +13, Nobility Lore +13, Society +13  **Int** +3 **Wis** +3, **Cha** +3  **Will** +14  * * *  Forged in platinum, a majordomo torc is engraved with heraldic insignias along with one language's alphabet, much like a choker of elocution. You gain a +1 item bonus to Society checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the torc's language. Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] from 5 to 3.  Upon being invested, the torc appoints itself your majordomo and, given the chance, takes over coordinating your social calendar, engagements, and wardrobe. A majordomo torc has a prim, fussy disposition, and although it defers to you, it can grow sardonic if you frequently ignore its advice. The torc has the following activation.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The majordomo torc casts [[Spells/Befitting Attire|Befitting Attire]] on you, usually to your specifications. However the torc can also choose the appearance of the illusion for you."
