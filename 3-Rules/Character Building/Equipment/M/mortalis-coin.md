description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You are reduced to 0 Hit Points by damage but not immediately killed  **Requirements** You are an expert in Fortitude saves.  * * *  This small golden coin is usually stamped with the image of a boar or other resilient creature. If the triggering damage would cause you to become dying 2 (typically due to a critical hit or your critical failure), you become dying 1 instead. In addition, for 10 minutes, you die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Mortalis Coin|Effect: Mortalis Coin]]"
