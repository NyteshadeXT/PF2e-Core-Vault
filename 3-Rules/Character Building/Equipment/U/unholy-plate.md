description: "Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of _+2 resilient full plate_ is designed to make you look like a horned demon with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.  While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They're a martial melee weapon with the effects of a +2 weapon potency rune. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 and unholy traits. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude check or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). The horns can't be etched with any runes.  If you're holy, you're [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and can't recover from this condition while wearing unholy plate.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Demonic Slip** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]].  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You're unholy; supply one casting of _translocate_."
