description: "This _standard-grade duskwood shield_ is perfectly symmetrical and incredibly sturdy despite its elaborate construction. These shields are typically given to the chosen emissaries of a kizidhar shuyookh, and the shuyookh's name and title are engraved in Muan behind the shield's handle.  * * *  **Activate - Repair** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You command the shield to repair itself, awakening the restorative magic within. For the next minute, the shield heals 3 Hit Points each round at the start of your turn.  * * *  **Activate - Secure Site** 10 minutes (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You place the _kizidhar's shield_ into the ground at the edge of your campsite, which can't be more than 30 feet on a side, then speak the name of the kizidhar shuyookh carved into its handle. The shuyookh briefly appears just long enough to make a sweeping gesture, causing sprawling thorns to grow in an unnaturally symmetrical formation around the campsite, protecting it for the next 8 hours with an effect that's otherwise identical to [[Spells/Wall of Thorns|Wall of Thorns]]. All creatures within the campsite are then immediately affected by a three-action [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell cast at 4th rank by the shield. After 8 hours, the wall rots away, and the shield can be retrieved as an Interact action."
