description: "The hilt of this _+3 major striking [[Equipment/Spell Reservoir|Spell-Storing]] longsword_ is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of _throneglass_â€”a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies. Whenever the _Kortos Diamond_ is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.  While wielding the _Kortos Diamond_, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against mental effects. You can never harm yourself with the _Kortos Diamond_, even if [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]].  If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the _Kortos Diamond_, the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are encumbered as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the _Kortos Diamond_ while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Effect** You attempt a melee Strike with the _Kortos Diamond_ against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal damage as normal and the target's mind is inflicted with a powerful disruptive energy. When the creature attempts to Cast a Spell, it must attempt a DC 44 Will check; on a failure, the spell fails and both the spell and the actions spent to cast it are lost. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per round  **Trigger** You damage an aberration with the _Kortos Diamond_  **Effect** You deal an additional 2d8 force damage to the struck creature.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You hold the _Kortos Diamond_ aloft and proclaim your might in a booming voice. You cast [[Spells/Overwhelming Presence|Overwhelming Presence]] (DC 42).  * * *  **Destruction** A deity who ascended to divinity via the _Test of the Starstone_ can damage and destroy the _Kortos Diamond_ as if it were not an artifact."
