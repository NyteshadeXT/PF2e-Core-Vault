description: "This cloth vestment features the heraldry or symbol associated with an entity (such as a deity, kingdom, or organization). Knights typically wear it over armor and other clothing, helping them identify allies on the battlefield or distinguishing themselves in more peaceful situations. An individual wearing a tabard gains a +1 item bonus to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on creatures who have a positive association with the entity represented on the tabard."
