description: "The appearance of this beautifully crafted _+2 disrupting greater striking lance_ changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes.  If a cavalier with the [[Feats/Cavalier's Banner|Cavalier's Banner]] feat takes the _knight captain's lance_, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` Interact  **Trigger** Your attack roll with the knight captain's lance is a critical success  * * *  **Effect** You raise the lance, inspiring those around you. Allies within 30 feet that can see you receive a +1 status bonus to their attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round."
