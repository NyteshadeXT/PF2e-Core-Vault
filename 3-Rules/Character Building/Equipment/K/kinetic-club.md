description: "Embedded along the length of this _+1 striking greatclub_ are the teeth and scales of a zetogeki, a giant lizard that can absorb and then release bursts of kinetic energy. The more momentum a wielder builds up while swinging the weapon, the more forceful the impact when it finally makes contact.  **Activateâ€”Store Kinetic Energy** `pf2:0` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You add a circumstance bonus to your attack with the _kinetic club's_ backswing trait and successfully Strike your target  * * *  **Effect** You channel the club's stored energy into the Strike, dealing 1d6 additional damage. If the club has a _greater striking_ rune, increase the additional damage to 2d6. If the club has a _major striking_ rune, increase the additional damage to 3d6."
