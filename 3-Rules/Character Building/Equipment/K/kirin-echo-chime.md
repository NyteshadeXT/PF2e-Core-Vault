description: "**Activate** Cast a Spell (add 1 action)  * * *  The echo of kirin's song can be captured within this small glass chime, which shatters and calls up a meandering breeze of its own when rung. Adding this catalyst to a [[Spells/Gust of Wind|Gust of Wind]] spell causes any flying creatures that would be pushed by the spell's effects to be pushed 30 feet in a direction of your choice, rather than 30 feet in the direction of the spell."
