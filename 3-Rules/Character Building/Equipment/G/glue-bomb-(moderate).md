description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  * * *  A glue bomb is a harmless explosive mechanism bursting with sticky substances. When you hit a creature with a glue bomb, that creature takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls, and the [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC is [[Actions/escape dc=19|escape dc=19]]{19}.  On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.  The target can end any effects by Escaping or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Glue Bomb|Effect: Glue Bomb]]"
