description: "A _growth gun_ is a _+1 striking hand cannon_ made from the regenerative flesh of a hydra, troll, or other similar creature. It has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined by the damage type selected for its modular trait. A _growth gun_ can be fired underwater, though it's still limited by the selected damage type as normal.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Wart Shot** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per minute  **Effect** Make a ranged Strike. On a hit, the creature becomes covered in a mass of flesh that continues to grow on the target for a brief time. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round, after which the growth withers and falls off.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the flesh of a creature with regeneration."
