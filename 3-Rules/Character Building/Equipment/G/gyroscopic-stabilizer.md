description: "A gyroscopic stabilizer appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the gyroscopic stabilizer to any one-handed firearm as an Interact action.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  **Requirements** The gyroscopic stabilizer is attached to a one-handed firearm without the fatal or fatal aim traits  * * *  **Effect** The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the fatal trait."
