description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You hit a target with a ranged Strike with the affixed weapon  **Requirements** You're an expert with the affixed weapon.  * * *  This talisman is a gold-plated brand that can be affixed to a ranged weapon's stock. When you activate a golden branding iron, you mark the target with your magical sigil.  You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, anywhere on the target creature, as long as the location is visible to you. The mark is only visible to you and up to 6 of your allies. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. It fades naturally over the course of a month."
