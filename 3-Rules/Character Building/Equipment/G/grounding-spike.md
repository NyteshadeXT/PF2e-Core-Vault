description: "Metal caps the bottom of this _+1 striking thundering dancer's spear_ and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a polarizing mace within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of grounding spike's damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.  **Special** The grounding spike pairs with the _polarizing mace_."
