description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried electric eel, roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Galvanic Chew|Effect: Galvanic Chew]]  * * *  **Secondary Effect** `pf2:r` (electricity)  **Trigger** You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature  **Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude check save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure).
