description: "This stone figurine of a chariot pulled by two horses was used by Tekritanin adults during strategy game competitions. Sometimes, though, mischievous adolescents snatched pieces like this one for joyriding.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large heavy chariot pulled by two animated stone war horses. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex check save; on a failure, a creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving."
