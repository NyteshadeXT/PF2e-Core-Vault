description: "Candlaron the Sculptor is one of Kyonin's most storied and honored wizards. While his final fate is unknown, his greatest creations, the aiudara, remain behind as a legacy of his power—as do other potent items, such as the _Guiding Star Orb_, a navigational traveling aid that the heroic wizard often relied upon when venturing into an unexplored part of the world.  * * *  **Activate—Embed Location** 10 minutes (concentrate);  By focusing on the _Guiding Star Orb_, you embed your current location in the item. Thereafter, anyone who holds the _Guiding Star Orb_ while Casting a Spell with the teleportation trait to travel to this location arrives precisely, without any inaccuracy at all. The _Guiding Star Orb_ can only have one location embedded at a time; if you use this activity a second time, the new location replaces the previous one.  * * *  **Activate—Momentary Aiudara** 10 minutes (concentrate, manipulate, teleportation)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cause a shimmering magical archway to appear next to you as the _Guiding Star Orb_ casts a 7th-rank [[Spells/Teleport|Teleport]] to your specifications. If you are teleporting to an aiudara you've visited before, you and the targets appear precisely at that location."
