description: "This sturdy pole has a rope attached to one end in a loop with the other end extending to the handle. You can pull the handle side of the rope to tighten the loop. Using this loop, you can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] without having a free hand. A creature grappled this way receives a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when Striking with an unarmed attack. Due to limitations in the size of the loop, a catch pole can only be used on creatures sized Medium or smaller.  A giant catch pole is made from thicker steel and heavier rope. It functions the same as a catch pole but can be used to Grapple creatures up to your normal size limit. However, the implement is so ungainly that you are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] while wielding it.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Catch Pole|Effect: Catch Pole]]"
