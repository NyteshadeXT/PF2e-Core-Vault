description: "The barrel of this long rifle is translucent in places, forming a swirled pattern along the metal, and its stock is formed of crimson wood. _Ghosthand's Comet_ is a _+4 major striking [[Equipment/Bane|Beast-Bane]] [[Equipment/Impactful (Greater)|Greater Impactful]]_ advanced firearm with a range increment of 300 feet. It deals 5d8 force damage and has the backstabber, concussive, kickback, and fatal d12 traits. As a star gun, _Ghosthand's Comet_ runs on magic and doesn't use ammunition or black powder. The weapon is silent when fired.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You attempt a ranged Strike with _Ghosthand's Comet_  **Effect** For the triggering Strike, _Ghosthand's Comet_ changes its damage type to your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Effect** On your next attempt at a ranged Strike with _Ghosthand's Comet_, the shot phases through any material or magical obstacle, such as a [[Spells/Wall of Force|Wall of Force]], in its path, ignoring all cover. You must attempt the Strike by the end of your turn or this effect is lost.  * * *  **Destruction** If the Grim Reaper slays the wielder of _Ghosthand's Comet_, the Reaper's scythe, as it strikes the killing blow, is destined to slice the star gun in half."
