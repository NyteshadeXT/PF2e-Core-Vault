description: "This watery, mint-green emetic of xulgath design is often carried in a delicate obsidian vial or other fragile container.  In the unfortunate circumstance that a creature has been Swallowed Whole by another creature, the swallowed creature can break open a vial of greengut to immediately induce vomiting.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  The swallower must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude check save or take 18d6 poison damage and possibly vomit the contents of its stomach.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature takes half damage.  **Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]], and vomits up any and all creatures Swallowed Whole on its next turn (a single action, which also allows it a Fortitude save against the sickened condition), as well as any stones or other objects it swallowed.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]."
