description: "Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this _+2 greater striking_ weapon can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the _gearblade_ must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a bastard sword, greatsword, longsword, or shortsword. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the disarm weapon trait and the versatile B weapon trait (which replaces any other versatile trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the gearblade, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a greatclub.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** You've wound the gearblade for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours  **Trigger** You roll a critical success to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] a target with the gearblade  * * *  **Effect** The target's weapon is pulled through the gearblade's gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a DC 36 Reflex check save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the _gearblade_, and the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure, they take 6d12 bludgeoning damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a [[Spells/Regenerate|Regenerate]] spell or a similar effect."
