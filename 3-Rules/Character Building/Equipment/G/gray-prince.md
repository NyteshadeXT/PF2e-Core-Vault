description: "While nothing created by the Ash Cult could be considered mass-produced, this _+1 striking ruinous hand cannon_ is by far their most popular design. The sleek body and intricate carving work make it a favorite accessory of certain aristocrats. The carving isn't merely decorative, however. Rather than a traditional maker's mark, Ornmarr etches excerpts of unreadable text onto each creation, hoping that one day his weapons will sing to another as the silver crystal once sang to him.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per hour;  **Effect** You fire a bolt of void energy, dealing 2d8 void damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line (DC 24 Reflex check saving throw). Creatures who critically fail their saving throw also take 1 persistent void damage for 1 minute."
