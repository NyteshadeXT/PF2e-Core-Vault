description: "This 6-foot-long scarf shimmers with the silvery light of the River of Souls while worn, providing illumination equivalent to that of a candle. You can deactivate or activate this radiance as an Interact action. The dangling lengths of a _ghost scarf_ softly billow in the presence of haunts, granting the wearer a +1 item bonus to all Perception checks and Perception DCs to resolve discovering a haunt or rolling initiative when a haunt triggers.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The scarf extends silvery threads that wrap around a weapon you carry, granting the effects of a [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]] property rune to that weapon for 5 minutes. If the weapon already bears a _ghost touch_ rune, you instead gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves against effects from incorporeal undead for 5 minutes.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Ghost Scarf|Effect: Ghost Scarf]]"
