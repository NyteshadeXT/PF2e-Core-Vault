description: "This _+2 greater striking composite shortbow_ is made from wood, horn, and sinew. Once wielded by Ninshaburian heretics, it's carried in a leather case etched with images of Namzaruum in combat with Somnalu. On a successful Strike, it deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You make a ranged Strike. On a hit, a vortex of air trails the arrow as it travels. When the arrow strikes its target, the vortex expands to a 30-foot radius from its point of impact. The arrow deals an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage against its target. For the next 3 minutes, any physical ranged attacks that would strike a target within the vortex deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The vortex is difficult terrain, and creatures attempting to fly through the vortex using a move action must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude check save, losing its move action on a failed save. Any gases within the vortex are cleared by the winds."
