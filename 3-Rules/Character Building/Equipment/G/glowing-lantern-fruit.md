description: "The flesh of this fruit pod resembles a stylized paper lantern, with a woody, geometric structure and thin layers of flesh, complete with a glow coming from the interior.  * * *  **Activate - Lantern Light** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Effect** The _glowing lantern fruit_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet) for 8 hours. While the light is shining, you can Interact with the _glowing lantern fruit_ to open or close some of its reflective leaves, making the light directional like a bull's-eye lantern or a hooded lantern.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Glowing Lantern Fruit (Lantern Light)|Effect: Glowing Lantern Fruit (Lantern Light)]]  * * *  **Activate - Fire Fruit** 10 minutes (manipulate)  **Effect** You plant the _glowing lantern fruit_ in the ground upside down. The petals of the lantern peel away, while the fruit inside glows hotter.
