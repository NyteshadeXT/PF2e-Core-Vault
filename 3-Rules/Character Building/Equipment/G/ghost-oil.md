description: "The vials containing this translucent, unsubstantial oil are always cold to the touch. Applying _ghost oil_ to a melee weapon you're wielding or carrying causes it to become semitransparent and gain the effects of a _[[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ rune, but it also makes the weapon unable to harm corporeal creatures. The oil has no effect when applied to another creature's weapon. The effect of the oil lasts for 1 minute.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Ghost Oil|Effect: Ghost Oil]]"
