description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Requirements** You're an expert in Stealth.  * * *  The Golden Gunners are dreaded for their use of their golden silencers, which they put to good use in clandestine raids. They silence both the loud gunshot and the screams of creatures wounded by its shot. A weapon with a golden silencer attached emits no light and makes no noise when fired. A target hit by a ranged Strike from the affixed weapon must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude check save or be silenced as well for 1 minute. A silenced creature can't call for help or use sonic abilities, nor can it use abilities with the auditory trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal components.  The silenced creature can attempt a new Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration early."
