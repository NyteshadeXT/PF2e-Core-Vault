description: "**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  A daub of ectoplasm twitches within this glass container, faintly glowing with ghostly light. When opened it forms the echo of a departed spirit, which looks like a Medium ghost. You can throw the ampoule up to 30 feet when you Activate it. The ghost utters a final lament, forcing each living creature in a 15-foot emanation except you to attempt a DC 18 Will check save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply ectoplasmic residue from a destroyed ghost."
