description: "When your attack roll with this weapon is a critical hit and gains the critical specialization effect, you gain an additional benefit depending on the weapon group.  **Axe** You can damage a third creature, with the same restrictions.  **Bow** The Athletics check to pull the missile free is DC 20.  **Brawling** The target takes a -4 circumstance penalty to its save.  **Club** You can knock the target up to 15 feet away.  **Crossbow** If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile, as the bow critical specialization.  **Dart** The base [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Bleed Damage]] increases to 2d6.  **Firearm** The target takes a -4 circumstance penalty to its save.  **Flail** You move the target 5 feet. You can't move it away from you, but you can move it in another direction of your choice.  **Hammer** You can also knock the target 5 feet away from you.  **Knife** The target takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speed while it has the [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Bleed Damage]].  **Pick** The extra damage from the critical specialization effect increases to 4 per weapon damage die.  **Polearm** You can move the target up to 10 feet.  **Shield** You can knock the target up to 10 feet away.  **Sling** The target also takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 round if it fails the save.  **Spear** The clumsy condition lasts for 2 rounds.  **Sword** The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn."
