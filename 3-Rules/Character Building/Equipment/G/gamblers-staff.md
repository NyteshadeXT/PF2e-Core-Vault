description: "A small glass orb on the head of a _gambler's staff_ holds a pair of six-sided dice that shift and roll within. Spellcasters who make their living via games of chance use _gamblers' staves_ to encourage the odds in their favor. Most gambling dens ban players they discover using such magic items. A _gambler's staff_ grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] from gambling (typically using Games Lore). To get this benefit, the staff must be on your person during all the downtime you spend gambling.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  * * *  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Wash Your Luck|Wash Your Luck]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Nudge the Odds|Nudge the Odds]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/Lucky Number|Lucky Number]] *   **3rd** [[Spells/Shift Blame|Shift Blame]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Read Omens|Read Omens]], [[Spells/Winning Streak|Winning Streak]] *   **5th** [[Spells/Nudge the Odds|Nudge the Odds]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells."
