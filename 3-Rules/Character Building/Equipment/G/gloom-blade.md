description: "As black as coal, this blade grows more potent in darkness. While in bright light, it functions as a _+1 shortsword_ and doesn't appear to radiate a magic aura to [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] or similar spells unless the spells are 4th rank or higher.  In dim light or darkness, the _gloom blade_ becomes a _+2 striking shortsword_. Whenever you use the _gloom blade_ to attack a creature you're undetected by, you deal 1d6 additional precision damage.  To upgrade the _gloom blade's_ fundamental runes, start with the base _+1 shortsword_, but if you improve it beyond a _+2 striking shortsword_, the runes apply in dim light or darkness as well."
