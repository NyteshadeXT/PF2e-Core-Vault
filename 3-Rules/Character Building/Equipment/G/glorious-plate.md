description: "This elegant full plate is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. _Glorious plate_ is _+2 resilient full plate_.  In battle, _glorious plate_ sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 Will check saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.  **Success** The enemy is unaffected.  **Failure** For 1 minute, the wearer's allies within the glorious plate's 10-foot radius of light are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.  **Critical Failure** As failure, except the wearer's allies are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to the enemy instead of concealed.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Effect** The armor casts [[Spells/Sanctuary|Sanctuary]] on you."
