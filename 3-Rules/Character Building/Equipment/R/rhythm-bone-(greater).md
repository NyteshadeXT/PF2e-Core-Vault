description: "This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Effect** The bone begins recording the next 10 minutes of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 20 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Effect** The bone replays its recorded sounds.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]]."
