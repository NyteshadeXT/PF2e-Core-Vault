description: "This _+3 greater resilient greater fortification breastplate_ absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to force damage. Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage.  After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Requirements** Your armor has absorbed at least 30 damage  **Effect** The absorbed energy explodes from your armor in a pulse of force. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation take 10d6 force damage with a DC 43 Fortitude check save. On a failure, they're pushed 10 feet away from you, and on a critical failure, they're pushed 20 feet away from you and fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The armor's absorbed damage resets to 0."
