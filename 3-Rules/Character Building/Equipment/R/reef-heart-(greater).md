description: "This _+2 greater resilient coral armor_, often favored by allies of merfolk and aquatic elves, is made of living coral carefully harvested from the ocean depths. Legends speak of a variety of similar coral armors with distinct powers, but surface-dwellers know of _reef heart_ as a magic armor that makes it easier for them to travel under the sea. _Reef heart_ enables you to breathe underwater and gives you a swim Speed equal to your land Speed.  **Activate** `pf2:3` command, envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast a 7th level [[Spells/Coral Eruption|Coral Eruption]]. If you conjure the coral underwater, it ceases dealing damage after 1 minute, but its duration is unlimited. If the magical coral remains in place for 1 year, it becomes non-magical coral from which a reef might grow."
