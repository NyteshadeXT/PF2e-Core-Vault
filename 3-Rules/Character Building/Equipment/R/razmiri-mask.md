description: "This mask is made of iron, though more potent versions crafted by powerful Razmiran priests can be made of silver, gold, or even porcelain. The wearer of this mask gains a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]].  * * *  **Activateâ€”Call Upon Razmir's Benevolence** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** You bend "divine" power to your will using the techniques taught you by the Razmiri priesthood. You grant a single target you touch a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level that last for 24 hours. If the target was [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], it regains consciousness and doesn't lose consciousness again due to Hit Point loss as long as it has temporary Hit Points from this effect remaining.
