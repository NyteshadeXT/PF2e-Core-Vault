description: "The ring is made from a lock of green hair woven around several small gemstones.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] (heightened to 4th level) on an animal or beast within 30 feet. If the spell succeeds, it forms a mental bond between you and the target for the duration of the charm, which allows you to remain aware of the creature's present state, its direction from you, its distance from you, and any conditions affecting it, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence and are both alive. If you fail to affect the creature with this _charm_, or once the _charm_ ends (such as if it is counteracted, or its duration expires), the creature becomes enraged and is immune to the ring's _charm_ from that point on. The creature's rage drives it to attack you and grants it a +1 item bonus on all checks and DCs to do so for 1 hour."
