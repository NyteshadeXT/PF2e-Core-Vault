description: "This _+2 striking dueling pistol_ is fashioned from silvery steel that glistens with a radiant light. You can choose to make a nonlethal attack with the redeemer's pistol without taking a -2 penalty; if you do so, the attack deals 1d6 additional mental damage. You can also call forth the redemptive spirit within the gun to pass judgment on your foes.  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet damages you  * * *  **Effect** The protective spirit within the gun imposes a vision of redemption in your foe's mind. The foe must choose one of the following options.  *   You're unharmed by the triggering damage. *   You gain resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of its next turn and takes 4 persistent spirit damage"
