description: "**Ammunition** Any  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  This arrow is made of polished animal horn, with the head of a rhinoceros carved in place of a traditional arrowhead. When an activated rhino shot is fired, the ethereal form of a large rhinoceros takes shape around the projectile. On a successful Strike, the attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude check or be knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the hit with the _rhino shot_ was a critical success, the target is knocked prone unless it critically succeeds at its save."
