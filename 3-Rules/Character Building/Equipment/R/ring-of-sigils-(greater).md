description: "This silver band is carved with the personal sigils of different individuals, adding one to represent you when you invest it. The ring allows you to cast [[Spells/Sigil|Sigil]] as an arcane innate cantrip.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Track Sigil** `pf2:1` (concentrate, detection)  **Frequency** once per 10 minutes  **Effect** You detect the general direction toward the most recent _sigil_ you created using the ring. This activation fails if the _sigil_ is more than 100 miles away or if there's lead or running water between you and the _sigil_. In addition, if the _sigil_ was placed on a living creature, you also determine whether the creature is alive, its distance from you, and any conditions affecting it."
