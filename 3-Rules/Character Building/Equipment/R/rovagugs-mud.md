description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Rovagug's mud smells and tastes like wet, sour earth. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against incapacitation effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 20-foot cone of bitter vapor that causes an earth-shaking rumble that can be heard for 100 feet. Creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 untyped damage (DC 30 Fortitude check), decreasing Hardness by 5. An object's Hardness remains lowered for 1d4 rounds, and you can't use this breath again for the same amount of time.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Rovagug's Mud|Effect: Rovagug's Mud]]"
