description: "Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create rime jars to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.  **Activate** `pf2:3` Interact  * * *  **Effect** The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold."
