description: "This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind.  While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers.  If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] and can't recover from this condition.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  * * *  **Effect** The Radiant Spark casts a 10th-rank [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] spell (DC 49 Will check) on a creature that isn't from the Material Plane. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You begin casting a [[Spells/Binding Circle|Binding Circle]] ritual  * * *  **Effect** The Radiant Spark reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision, Interact  **Trigger** The target critically fails their save against the Radiant Spark's dominate spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the planar binding ritual using the artifact  * * *  **Effect** The target must attempt a DC 49 Will check save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]].  **Failure** The target dies and its essence is trapped within the Radiant Spark. It can be brought back to life only with powerful magic such as [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] or [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]].  **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't be brought back to life until the Radiant Spark is destroyed.  * * *  **Destruction** An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod."
