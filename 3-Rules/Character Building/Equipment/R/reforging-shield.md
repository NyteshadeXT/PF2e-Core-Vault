description: "This steel shield contains a smoldering core of magma that never cools. Whenever the reforging shield's current Hit Points are below its Break Threshold, the shield recovers 5 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn each round until it is no longer broken. Each time a character Repairs the shield, the shield recovers double the number of Hit Points. The shield has Hardness 15, HP 120, and BT 60."
