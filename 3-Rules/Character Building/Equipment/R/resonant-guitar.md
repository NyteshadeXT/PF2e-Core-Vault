description: "Every part of this dark, shining guitar, from the strings to the soundboard, is constructed of metal. When the strings are strummed, the gilding on the guitar ripples like a liquid. A _resonant guitar_ is a virtuoso handheld musical instrument that grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks attempted while using it.  A _resonant guitar_ is a planar key for [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] and similar magic to travel to the Plane of Metal. When using it in this way, you can play a tune inspired by your destination to make it more likely to arrive where you intend to be, appearing 1d6×25 miles from your intended destination instead of 1d10×25 miles away.  * * *  **Activate-Strum of Thunder** 1 minute (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You play a magnetic tune, enchanting one metallic weapon within 60 feet of you. This item gains the [[Equipment/Thundering|Thundering]] rune for 1 hour.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Strum of Thunder|Effect: Strum of Thunder]]  * * *  **Activate-Chord of Protection** `pf2:r` (manipulate)  **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you or an ally with a melee attack  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You strike a piercing chord, putting up an invisible sound barrier between the target and the attacker. The target gains a +2 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the Strike still hits, the barrier breaks, dealing 3d10 sonic damage to the attacker."
