description: "**Usage** affixed to armor  **Activate** `pf2:0` command  **Requirements** You have a free hand.  * * *  This triangular prism showing swirling black patterns inside constantly moves around on your armor, no matter where you affix it. When you activate this talisman, any item in your possession of 1 bulk or less, chosen when you activate the prism, immediately teleports into your hand.  The retrieval prism can't retrieve an item that's not on your plane, including one that's in an extradimensional space like a bag of holding. If you haven't expended the talisman, you can attune it to a different item by Affixing the Talisman again.  You don't need to attune the prism. It can retrieve any item in your possession of 1 Bulk or less, chosen when you activate the prism."
