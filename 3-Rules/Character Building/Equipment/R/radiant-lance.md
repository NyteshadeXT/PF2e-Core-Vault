description: "When wielded in battle, these silver lances blaze with light. A _radiant lance_ is a _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] [[Equipment/Flaming|Flaming]] silver lance_.  * * *  When wielded in battle, the _radiant lance_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius.  * * *  On a hit against an undead creature that is specifically vulnerable to sunlight, the lance bursts with a brilliant flash of light, and that undead must attempt a DC 35 Fortitude check save. If the attack was a critical hit, the undead uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.  **Success** The undead is unaffected.  **Failure** The undead is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.  **Critical Failure** The undead is slowed 1 for 1 minute.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You point the lance at a foe and call out, firing a beam with the effects of a 7th-rank [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]]."
