description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You use the affixed shield to Shield Block a melee attack  **Requirements** You're a master in Athletics, and you have the affixed shield raised.  * * *  This heavy metal emblem is mounted on the face of the affixed shield and has a dull gray gemstone embedded at its center. When you Activate the talisman, the gem shatters, releasing a powerful shockwave in a 30-foot cone that must include the enemy who struck the triggering blow, if possible. Each creature in the cone takes 3d6 sonic with a DC 34 Fortitude check. Any creature that fails its save is pushed 5 feet away from you (or 10 feet on a critical failure)."
