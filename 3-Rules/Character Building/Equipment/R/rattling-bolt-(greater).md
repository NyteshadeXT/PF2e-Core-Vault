description: "**Ammunition** bolts  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  Sometimes when dealing with undead incursions, a more subtle approach is called for. Paradoxically, this is precisely what the rattling bolts are most often used for, despite each one ringing like a shaken chain when launched. Once it hits the target, the rattling transfers into that creature's body. A target damaged by the rattling bolt must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude check save or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round (or 1 minute on a critical hit). An undead affected by a rattling bolt further loses any lifesense ability it might have had for the same duration as the deafening."
