A chochori whistlespear is a heavy spear optimized for battle underwater, which releases its namesake whistle as it pierces the waves, the last thing many a chochori’s foe ever hears before their demise. When facing particularly bony foes, the spear’s side can be used as a blunt weapon.

A chochori whistlespear is an uncommon advanced melee weapon in the spear weapon group that deals 1d10 piercing damage and has the reach and versatile bludgeoning traits. A whistlespear has been carefully designed such that the wielder doesn’t take a circumstance penalty when using it to deal bludgeoning damage underwater. Lastly, the wielder can cause the spear to produce its namesake whistle, allowing them to add the spear’s item bonus to Performance checks when using the spear to play as a wind instrument. However, a bard isn’t capable of using a whistlespear to replace material components.
