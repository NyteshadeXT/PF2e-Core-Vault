_Old Woody_ is a legendary brew, a strange magical alcohol that produces randomized effects. Its price and taste vary wildly based on the year of the brew, which can not only change the taste, but also cause it to have different effects than the ones listed below, or make some of the effects more likely than others. Some brews of _Old Woody_ even have a different item level. A single drink from a typical brew of _Old Woody_ sells for around 50 gp, if you can find one. After drinking _Old Woody_, roll a d100, and apply the listed effect. If you didnâ€™t willingly drink the _Old Woody_, you can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude check save to negate the effect. After drinking _Old Woody_, you are temporarily immune to the effects of further drinks of _Old Woody_ for 24 hours.
