A hardriggan jagblade is a sword with jagged chunks of metal throughout, built to cause additional pain and bleeding with its serrated edges, disarm and impale foes, and intimidate onlookers. The disadvantage with the design is that it doesnâ€™t have high structural integrity and is prone to snapping with overuse; thus, hardriggans sometimes go through low quality hardriggan jagblades every few battles. Fortunately, high quality or magical hardriggan jagblades can pass the test of time. A hardriggan jagblade is an uncommon advanced melee weapon in the sword weapon group that deals 1d8 slashing damage and has the disarm, grapple, and versatile piercing traits. It uses the critical specialization effect for daggers instead of the usual critical specialization effect for swords.
