description: "This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of [[thieves-toolkit-(infiltrator)|Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)]] and any [[thieves-toolkit-(infiltrator-picks)|Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator Picks)]], an [[disguise-kit-elite|Disguise Kit (Elite)]] and any [[disguise-kit-elite-cosmetics|Disguise Kit (Elite Cosmetics)]], and an [[climbing-kit-extreme|Climbing Kit (Extreme)]], all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the encompassing lockpick a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk."
