description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  When created, this mutagen is attuned to one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When consumed, the mutagen suffuses your body with energy that spills out whenever you attack. At higher levels, it can even grant you the ability to unleash the energy in controlled bursts.  **Benefit** You gain resistance 10 to the attuned energy type. Whenever you score a hit with a melee weapon, add 1d4 damage of the attuned energy type.  **Drawback** You gain weakness 5 to the other three energy types.  **Duration** 10 minutes.
