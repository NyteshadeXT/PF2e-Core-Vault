description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Bright pink, pale lavender, and vibrant orange colors swirl through this purplish liquid, making the eidetic potion resemble an unforgettable sunset. When you drink this potion, for 1 round, anything you observe becomes locked into your memory. You can recall the memory perfectly and gain a +2 status bonus to create representations of that memory, whether using Crafting to create an artistic rendition or Society to create a Forgery. The memory remains locked for 1 week or until you benefit from the bonus it imparts for the first time, whichever comes first; afterward, it becomes a normal, fallible memory. You can only have a single memory locked in your mind at a time. Using this potion while you have a locked memory from a previous use makes the previously locked memory fallible but allows you to lock a new memory."
