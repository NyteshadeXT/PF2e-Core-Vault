description: "Resembling _frozen lava_, an eternal eruption is made with the same type of time magic, but is built to loop through time, reforming itself after it's used. Determining the difference between the two requires a close examination to see a faint, repeating pattern of red runes.  **Activateâ€”Lava Bomb** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** You fling the _eternal eruption_, with the effect of _[[Equipment/Frozen Lava of Sakalayo|Frozen Lava of Sakalayo]]_. After 2d4 hours, the _eternal eruption_ reforms itself in a container on your person, typically the one you most recently stored it in.  * * *  _Eternal Eruption of Sakalayo_ deals 17d6 fire on a DC 39 Reflex check."
