description: "**Ammunition** Arrow  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat. When you fire an activated _enfilading arrow_, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a 10-foot burst at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all creatures in the area (DC 25 Reflex check).  If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds."
