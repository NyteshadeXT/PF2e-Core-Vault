description: "This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat. When you fire an activated _enfilading arrow_, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a 10-foot burst at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing `dice: 6d8` piercing damage to all creatures in the area (DC 25 Reflex check).  If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the target is [[Immobilized]] and must spend an [[Interact]] action to attempt a DC 10 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds."
