description: "The pale liquid of empath's cordial changes color to reflect the mood of the creature nearest to it—turning blue for calm, red for anger, and green for envious, among other hues. For 1 hour after you drink this potion, you can sense the presence of general emotions, such as hostility toward you or the presence of an emotion effect impacting a creature's emotions, within 30 feet. A creature that failed a saving throw against calm emotions can't be detected. This potion doesn't allow you to automatically tell what emotions a specific creature is experiencing, but you can attempt a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check with a +2 item bonus (DC set by the GM) to discern that information. The potion also grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks to [[Sense Motive]] against creatures whose emotions you can sense."
