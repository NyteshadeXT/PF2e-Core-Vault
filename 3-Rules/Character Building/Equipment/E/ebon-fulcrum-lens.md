description: "_Fulcrum lenses_ are unique magical crystals that each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth's essence. They belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four of the lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth's attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the _Fulcrum Lattice_ to hold the lenses so that their power could be focused together. She realized the danger of keeping the _fulcrum lenses_ too close together until the right time and spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults' lowest levels for safekeeping.\n\nBelcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_, with her—indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.\n\nBelcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_, with her—indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.\n\nThis strangest and most powerful of the _fulcrum lenses_ resembles a chip of smooth obsidian containing three dark glimmers of Nhimbaloth's essence. Incorporeal creatures can touch and carry the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_. While you have the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_ invested, and you're a corporeal creature, you become insubstantial, gain the incorporeal trait, and are [[Drained|Drained 2]]. Your drained condition can't be reduced below 2 as long as you have the lens invested. You can activate the lens in the following ways. Both require expenditures of glimmers within the lens; once the lens is depleted of its three glimmers, it retains its ability to make corporeal creatures insubstantial but can't be used for its other abilities until its glimmers are restored (which generally requires a ritual or being steeped in an area of Nhimbaloth's power)."
