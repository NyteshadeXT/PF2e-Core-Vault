description: "This _+1 striking [[Equipment/Hand Cannon|Hand Cannon]]_ is festooned with so many add-ons and modifications it's barely recognizable as a firearm. A large hopper at the top of the gun allows any type of ammunition (including arrows, bolts, stone bullets, and firearm rounds) to be fed into the machine, which converts the ammunition into blasts of raw, destructive energy. Each time you attack with the weapon, roll 1d8 to determine the damage type of the Strike—all of the _erraticannon_'s weapon damage is converted to that damage type for the Strike. Additionally, roll another d8, and the _erraticannon_ deals 1d6 additional damage of this second damage type.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Erraticannon|Effect: Erraticannon]]      | **d8** | **Damage Type** | | --- | --- | | 1 | Acid | | 2 | Cold | | 3 | Electricity | | 4 | Fire | | 5 | Sonic | | 6 | Bludgeoning | | 7 | Piercing | | 8 | Slashing |  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You set the _erraticannon_ to maximum power and unleash a blast that deals 1d6 acid, 1d6 cold, 1d6 electricity, 1d6 fire, 1d6 sonic, 1d6 bludgeoning, 1d6 piercing, and 1d6 slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25 Reflex check save)."
