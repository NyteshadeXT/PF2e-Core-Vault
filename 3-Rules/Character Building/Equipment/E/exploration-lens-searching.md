description: "An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Lantern (Bull's Eye)]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.  Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Wayfinder]] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a [[Lantern (Hooded)]], [[Torch]], or [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/L/Light|Light]] spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.\n\nThere are several different types of _exploration lens_, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.\n\n**Type: Searching**  This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light.  The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks to spot such features while [[Search|Searching]].  Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search."
