description: "This simple, mass-produced gaiter mask is standard issue for miners working in deep, dangerous mines. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against inhaled poisons. An _everair mask_ makes use of magical runes related to the Plane of Air to create breathable air.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You activate the mask's rune, and the air surrounding air, as well as the air you exhale, becomes enriched with oxygen. This allows the _everair mask_ to recycle air into breathable air for 24 hours. The rune's magic is unable to provide breathable air while underwater, in a vacuum, or in any other situation where air is normally unavailable."
