description: "This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called [[aeon stones]]. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe.\n\nPathfinder Society researchers recently created elemental wayfinders with the assistance of the Society's elemental allies. In addition to the effects of a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]], these wayfinders each grant the ability to cast a particular elemental spell once per day, and can assist Pathfinders in exploring areas associated with their element. Each has the trait associated with its element. Additionally, you gain resistance 5 to fire."
