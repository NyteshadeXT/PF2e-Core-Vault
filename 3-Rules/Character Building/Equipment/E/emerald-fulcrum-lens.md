description: "Fulcrum lenses are unique magical crystals that each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth's essence. They belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four of the lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth's attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the Fulcrum Lattice to hold the lenses so that their power could be focused together. She realized the danger of keeping the fulcrum lenses too close together until the right time and spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults' lowest levels for safekeeping.\n\nBelcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the _Ebon Fulcrum Lens_, with her—indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.\n\nThe _fulcrum lenses_ are more than mere receptacles of Nhimbaloth's essence. Each grants those who use it a fragment of the Great Old One's power.\n\nThis concave green lens is pitted and flawed; its jagged edges can cut those who don't handle it with care. While you have the _Emerald Fulcrum Lens_ invested, your flesh appears waxen and pallid. You gain void healing and [[Harm]] spells gain a +4 status bonus to the Hit Points they restore to you. You can also activate the lens in the following ways."

frequency1: "once per day"
trigger2:
mechanics2: " While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +20. On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens."
