description: |
  Distilled from the energy of dangerous spells, an _energy breath potion_ grants you the Energy Breath action for 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on how long the distilled ingredients were aged. This potion has the trait matching the damage type.
