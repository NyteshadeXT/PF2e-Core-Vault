description: "You arrange a spiky cage of bones, particularly tough vegetation, or other material to spring up when disturbed. The snare deals `dice: 10d8` piercing damage to the first creature to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 34 Reflex check save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n**Success** The creature is knocked aside by the snare's deployment, takes half damage, and is [[Off-Guard]] until the end of its next turn.\n**Failure** The creature is captured by the cage, taking full damage and falling [[Prone]]. It's [[Immobilized]] while it remains within the cage. It can get free by [[Escape|escapeing]] (DC 34) or by destroying the cage (AC 30, Fort +18, Ref +24, Hardness 5, HP 30, object immunities).\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage."
