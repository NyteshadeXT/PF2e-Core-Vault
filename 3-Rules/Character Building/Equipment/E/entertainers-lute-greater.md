description: "This lustrous lute has a polished body that changes to show whatever decorations or carvings you find most appealing, or which best reinforce the story of the song you're currently playing (as a free action). Its frets are inlaid with mother of pearl. With its mix of enchantment and illusion magic, it's favored by many traveling minstrels. While playing the lute, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] checks."
