description: "Members of the Empty Hand consider themselves leaders of Belkzen, and their fearsome reputation has helped control Urgir for generations. As a proud member or honored guest of the hold, you've been allowed to bear their mark. The tattoo depicts a partially closed hand that grasps nothing. Many people wear this tattoo on their faces, but others have it on an exposed shoulder or arm."
