description: "This fist-sized, 12-rayed black star sapphire is sacred to Yueral, the elven goddess of magic and jewels, and most accounts of its creation attribute its crafting to a circle of her worshippers. In addition to the abilities listed below, the gem functions as a portal key for Jewelgate at Alseta's Ring.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You touch the _Eye of the Wise_ to a gem worth at least 10 gp, whereupon the _Eye of the Wise_ assumes the appearance of the touched gemstone. While this connection is active, the carriers of the _Eye of the Wise_ and of the other gemstone can communicate telepathically with one another over any distance, as long as both are on the same plane. This connection is broken if the other gemstone is damaged, if the _Eye of the Wise_ becomes attuned to another gemstone, or if the bearer of the _Eye of the Wise_ dismisses the activation.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You hold the _Eye of the Wise_ up to your own eye and peer through it. The _Eye of the Wise_ grows transparent and grants you a +2 item bonus to attempts to Decipher Writing, Disable a Device, Identify Magic, Pick a Lock, Seek, or Sense Motive. You can Sustain this activation as long as you hold the gem in place."
