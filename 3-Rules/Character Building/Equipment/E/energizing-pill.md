description: "This special blend of potent herbs comes in the form of a compact ball that allows it to be held in the mouth, where it remains for 1 hour. An energizing pill has a bitter taste at first, but the longer one lets it soak, the more complex and sweet its flavor grows. It heightens your reactions, granting you a +2 item bonus to initiative rolls with [[Skills#Perception|Perception]]."
