description: "This special blend of potent herbs comes in the form of a compact ball that allows it to be held in the mouth, where it remains for 1 hour. An energizing pill has a bitter taste at first, but the longer one lets it soak, the more complex and sweet its flavor grows. It heightens your reactions, granting you a +2 item bonus to initiative rolls with Perception.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Energizing Pill|Effect: Energizing Pill]]  **Secondary Effect** `pf2:r`  **Trigger** You would become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]]  * * *  **Effect** Reduce the value of the condition you just gained by 1; if this reduces the value to 0, you don't gain the triggering condition."
