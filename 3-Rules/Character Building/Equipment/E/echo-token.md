description: "Visitors to the Echo Repository always emerge with one of these silver coins, stamped with the visage of a faceless queen, somewhere on their person. An _echo token_ carries a minute shard of the Echo Repository's mission to impart lost information."

mechanics1: "When flipped, the coin disintegrates into a glittery mist. You learn and memorize one random fact about a specific type of [[Skills#Lore|Lore]] (such as Architecture Lore, Elf Lore, Astral Plane Lore) that you didn't previously know, chosen by the GM. The next time you attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] on this type of Lore within the next year, you gain a +1 status bonus on the check. You can benefit from only one _echo token_ at a time in this way; if you Flip another _echo token_, the Lore skill changes. However, the memorized fact will remain perfectly in your memory forever unless magically altered or removed."
