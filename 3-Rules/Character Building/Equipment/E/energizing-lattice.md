description: "This suit of _[[armor-potency-2|+2]] [[resilient]] [[fortification]] [[lattice armor]]_ has latticework of fine golden wire. After negating a critical hit with its _fortification_ rune, the latticework glows for 1 minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). You can Dismiss this light."
