# Essence Charm
## Item 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Anyone can use an essence forge to craft an essence charm without needing to know the formula for an essence charm. No larger than a coin, an essence charm is normally worn around the neck or hung from a belt—its exact appearance is up to the crafter. When an essence charm is created, its crafter selects a skill in which they are at least trained. The essence charm grants a +1 item bonus to that skill when worn.

**Activate—Lucky Charm** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a check using the essence charm's chosen skill

* * *

**Effect** A failed check becomes a success, and a critical failure becomes a failure.
