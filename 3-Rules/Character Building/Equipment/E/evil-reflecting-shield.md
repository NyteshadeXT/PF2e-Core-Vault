description: "A bright, octagonal frame surrounds this circular dawnsilver shield, which itself is polished to a mirrorlike sheen that reflects clear and true. While you have this standard-grade dawnsilver shield (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10) raised, you gain its circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells with the unholy or void trait.  **Activate** `pf2:r` command (fortune)  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against an effect with the unholy or void traits  * * *  **Effect** Your saving throw result is considered one degree better than the actual result. If this effect turns a success into a critical success, you can reflect some of the effect's power as a wave of magical backlash back to the source of the triggering effect, as long as the source is within 30 feet. When you do so, the target must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude check save or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]."
