description: "A bright, octagonal frame surrounds this circular dawnsilver shield, which itself is polished to a mirrorlike sheen that reflects clear and true. While you have this [[dawnsilver-shield-standard-grade|Dawnsilver Shield (Standard Grade)]] raised, you gain its circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells with the unholy or void trait."

mechanics1: "Your saving throw result is considered one degree better than the actual result. If this effect turns a success into a critical success, you can reflect some of the effect's power as a wave of magical backlash back to the source of the triggering effect, as long as the source is within 30 feet. When you do so, the target must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude check save or become [[Stunned|Stunned 1]]."
