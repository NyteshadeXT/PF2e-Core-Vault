description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Equipment/Lantern (Bull's Eye)|Bull's Eye Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.  Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a [[Equipment/Lantern (Hooded)|Lantern (Hooded)]], [[Equipment/Torch|Torch]], or [[Spells/Light|Light]] spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.  There are several different types of _exploration lens_, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.  * * *  **Type: Investigating**  The outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light.  While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge while [[Actions/Investigate|Investigating]] by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory.  If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative."
