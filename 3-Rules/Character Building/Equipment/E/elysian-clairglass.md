description: "Used by soldiers who battle on the borderlands of Elysium, particularly in Gorum's realm of Clashing Shore, these bronze spyglasses are somewhat plain-looking save for a single diamond set into the largest cylinder. An _Elysian clairglass_ functions like a typical spyglass, but you can see twenty times farther while looking through it, rather than eight times farther. It also grants a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks to notice details at a distance."

mechanics1: "The _Elysian clairglass_ casts [[clairaudience]] and [[clairvoyance]] on the area you are currently observing with it. As long as you're holding the _Elysian clairglass_, you can speak through the floating eye or ear created by its spells, causing your voice to manifest as a whisper that only one person in range of the spells can hear, as a booming voice that everyone in range of the spells can hear, or as any combination in between those two extremes."
