description: "Used by soldiers who battle on the borderlands of Elysium, particularly in Gorum's realm of Clashing Shore, these bronze spyglasses are somewhat plain-looking save for a single diamond set into the largest cylinder. An _Elysian clairglass_ functions like a typical spyglass, but you can see twenty times farther while looking through it, rather than eight times farther. It also grants a +3 item bonus to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.  * * *  **Activate—Seek and Speak** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The _Elysian clairglass_ casts clairaudience and clairvoyance on the area you are currently observing with it. As long as you're holding the _Elysian clairglass_, you can speak through the floating eye or ear created by its spells, causing your voice to manifest as a whisper that only one person in range of the spells can hear, as a booming voice that everyone in range of the spells can hear, or as any combination in between those two extremes.  * * *  **Activate—Pinpoint** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Pinpoint|Pinpoint]]."
