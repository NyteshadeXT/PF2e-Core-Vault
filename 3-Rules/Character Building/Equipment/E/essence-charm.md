description: "Anyone can use an essence forge to craft an essence charm without needing to know the formula for an essence charm. No larger than a coin, an essence charm is normally worn around the neck or hung from a belt—its exact appearance is up to the crafter. When an essence charm is created, its crafter selects a skill in which they are at least trained. The essence charm grants a +1 item bonus to that skill when worn.  **Activate—Lucky Charm** `pf2:r` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a check using the essence charm's chosen skill  * * *  **Effect** A failed check becomes a success, and a critical failure becomes a failure."
