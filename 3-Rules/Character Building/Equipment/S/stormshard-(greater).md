description: "These shards of coalesced necromantic essence are sometimes found in the wake of an ancestor storm. Howling spirits are faintly visible, trapped inside the jagged, dark-green glass.  You can use the shard to cow the undead or briefly release the tormented souls from inside the glass. While you hold the stormshard, you gain a +2 item bonus to Intimidation checks to influence the undead. In addition, you can [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] undead creatures, even if those creatures are mindless or otherwise immune to emotion, fear, or mental effects.  **Activateâ€”Free the Spirits** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You briefly release the spirits from the _stormshard_ before drawing them back into the glass. Each creature in a 10-foot emanation takes 8d8 void damage (DC 29 Fortitude check save). You treat the result of your saving throw as one degree of success better than its outcome. You can choose to increase the radius of the emanation by up to 10 feet."
