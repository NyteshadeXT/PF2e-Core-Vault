description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.  When an activated _storm arrow_ hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25 Reflex check saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a _shock_ property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn't benefit from the _shock_ property rune itself.  * * *  **Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.  **Success** The foe takes half damage and isn't affected by the wind.  **Failure** The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the foe takes double damage."
