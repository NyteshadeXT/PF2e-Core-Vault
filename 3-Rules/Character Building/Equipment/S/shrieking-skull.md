description: "**Usage** affixed to a firearm or crossbow  **Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Requirements** You're an expert in Intimidation and the affixed weapon is loaded.  * * *  This dried skull of a snake is mounted atop the firearm's barrel or affixed to a crossbow's stock. When activated, the skull crawls onto the ammunition loaded in the affixed weapon. If you Strike with the weapon before the end of your turn, the skull lets out a bloodcurdling scream as the ammunition approaches its target. Regardless of whether the Strike is a success, the screaming skull allows you to attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the target as well as each enemy within 30 feet of the target."
