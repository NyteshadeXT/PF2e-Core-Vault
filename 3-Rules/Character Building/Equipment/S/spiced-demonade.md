description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  There are some who claim that the original version of this tart red drink contained the ground skin of actual demons, but in truth, spiced demonade was created by a first-year academy student desperate to look awake and alert after a night of carousing.  After consuming spiced demonade, you ignore all effects and penalties from the consumption of alcohol and lack of sleep for 1 hour. These effects resume when the spiced demonade wears off, and you become temporarily immune to spiced demonade for 24 hours."
