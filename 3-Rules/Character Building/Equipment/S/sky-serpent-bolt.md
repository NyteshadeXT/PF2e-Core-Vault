description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` or `pf2:2` Interact  * * *  This azure bolt is carved in the shape of an undulating snake, its bared fangs framing the point of its head. When an activated sky serpent bolt successfully hits a target, the bolt takes the form of a snake made of pure lightning, dealing 2d12 electricity damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line (DC 19 Reflex check save) starting from the target. If you spent 2 actions to activate the sky serpent bolt, then the line is 60 feet long, and at a single point in the line, you can change the remainder of the line's path by up to a 90-degree angle."
