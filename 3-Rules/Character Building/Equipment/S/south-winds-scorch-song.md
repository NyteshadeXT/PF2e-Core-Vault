description: "This _+1 striking flaming scimitar_ is always warm to the touch, nearly unbearably so. Lines of crackling flame radiate from carnelians affixed to its curved and blackened blade, and its pommel ends in a brilliant tassel of phoenix feathers. While you have a status bonus to at least one of your Speeds, your Strikes with this scimitar that deal fire damage gain a +2 status bonus to their fire damage. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ South Wind's Scorch Song (Damage)|Effect: South Wind's Scorch Song (Damage)]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` command (evocation, fire, magical)  **Trigger** Your spell deals fire damage to a creature  * * *  **Effect** You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your next turn.
