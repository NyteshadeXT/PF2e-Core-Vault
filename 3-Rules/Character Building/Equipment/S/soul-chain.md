description: "A _soul chain_ is a _+1 striking [[Equipment/Spiked Chain|Spiked Chain]]_ that has become cursed after a forge-spurned used it to kill a creature and trap its soul. In the hands of a forge-spurned, a soul chain inflicts an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Other creatures can use a _soul chain_ as a standard _+1 striking spiked chain_. A soul chain fuses with its wielder the first time the wielder damages a living creature with the weapon. A character who dies while carrying a _soul chain_ must attempt a DC 20 Will check save; on a failure, they're immediately transformed into a forge-spurned. Carrying multiple _soul chains_ doesn't increase the DC of the save, but the carrier must attempt the save once for each chain they carry."
