description: "These black leather goggle frames have no lenses. Instead, when a character puts them on and invests them, the wearer's eyes transform and lengthen into snail-like eyestalks. The wobbly eyestalks stretch out through the lens holes and up over the wearer's head on lengthened optic nerves.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** By focusing hard, you can watch for enemies in all directions. You gain all-around vision, low-light vision, and a +2 item bonus to Perception checks involving sight for 1 minute; during this time, you can't be flanked.
