description: "This sturdy pole has a rope attached to one end in a loop with the other end extending to the handle. You can pull the handle side of the rope to tighten the loop. Using this loop, you can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] without having a free hand. A creature grappled this way receives a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when Striking with an unarmed attack. Due to limitations in the size of the loop, a catch pole can only be used on creatures sized Medium or smaller.  A superior catch pole has a pole made of dawnsilver, and the loop at the end is silk rope, making it sturdier and more agile. It functions the same as a catch pole but gives you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks made to Grapple with it.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Catch Pole|Effect: Catch Pole]]"
