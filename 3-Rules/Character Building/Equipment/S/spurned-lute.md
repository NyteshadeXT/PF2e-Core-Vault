description: "Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a _spurned lute_ is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a virtuoso instrument. (Other _spurned instruments_ exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its "partner" musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to [[Actions/Perform|Perform]], you become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a Performance check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 Will check save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute."
