description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You attempt a Will save against a mental enchantment spell, but you haven't rolled yet  **Requirements** You have master proficiency in Will saves.  * * *  Found throughout Golarion, these star-shaped talismans of whalebone scrimshaw are carved by Erutaki from the Crown of the World. They are popular with adherents to the cult of Desna, who believe the talismans protect their dreams.  When you activate this talisman, you gain a +2 status bonus to saves against enchantment magic with the mental trait for 1 minute. On the triggering save, if the outcome of the roll is a failure, you get a success instead, or if the outcome is a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
