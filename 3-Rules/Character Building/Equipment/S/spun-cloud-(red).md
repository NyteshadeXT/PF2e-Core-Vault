description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  On the Elemental Plane of Air, small clouds of differing colors can sometimes float separately from other cloud formations. Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, _spun clouds_ don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.  A red cloud terrifies those it surrounds. Any creature in the cloud, or that later enters the cloud, must succeed at a DC 24 Will check save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). Regardless of the result of its save, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect."
