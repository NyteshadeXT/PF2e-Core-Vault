description: "This elegant black, gold-tipped _+1 striking fighting fan_ is adorned with images of three golden leaves and a red rope tassel. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by a _spirit fan_, the golden leaves on the fan light up, providing illumination equal to that of a torch for 1 minute.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Spirit Fan|Effect: Spirit Fan]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Requirements** The _spirit fan_'s leaves are illuminated  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You sweep the _spirit fan_ in the direction of a single target you can see within 30 feet, releasing the life energy in the form of a streak of golden light.
