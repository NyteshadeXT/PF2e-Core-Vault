description: "**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  Derived from a mixture of krooth venom and an agitating agent, scarlet mist causes bleeding that turns into a foaming mist. When a creature under the effects of scarlet mist takes persistent bleed damage from the toxin, creatures within 5 feet take the splash damage. The persistent damage can't be staunched until the poison's effects end. A creature that can't bleed doesn't take the bleed damage or cause the splash damage but can still take the poison damage.  **Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude check  **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds  **Stage 1** 3d6 poison, 1d4 bleed, and 1 poison splash damage (1 round)  **Stage 2** 3d6 poison, 2d4 bleed, and 2 poison splash damage (1 round)  **Stage 3** 3d6 poison, 3d4 bleed, and 3 poison splash damage (1 round)"
