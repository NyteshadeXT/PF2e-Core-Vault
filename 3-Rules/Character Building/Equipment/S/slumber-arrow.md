description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated sleep arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it grows lethargic and must attempt a DC 17 Will check saving throw. On a failure, it takes a â€“5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round, and is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round on a critical failure.  **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of _sleep_."
