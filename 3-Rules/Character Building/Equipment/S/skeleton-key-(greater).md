description: "A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of thieves' toolkit when attempting to Pick a Lock, and it grants a +2 item bonus to the Thievery check.  If the _skeleton key_ becomes broken due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal thieves' toolkit and loses its benefits until repaired.  **Activateâ€”Loosen Lock** `pf2:0` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You attempt to Pick a Lock but haven't rolled yet  * * *  **Effect** The key casts [[Spells/Knock|Knock]] on the lock you're trying to pick."
