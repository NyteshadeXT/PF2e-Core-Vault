description: "Some mutants savor the acrid smog of Alkenstar and the Gunworks. A _smogger_ recreates this pollution by sucking in clean air and spewing it back out as pungent smog.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` (poison) Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** The _smogger_ creates a 10-foot-radius emanation of smog centered on you, which moves with you. You and other creatures in the smog are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while inside the smog, and other creatures are concealed to you and other creatures in the smog. A strong wind doesn't disperse the smog but reduces it to a 5-foot- radius emanation. A creature that must breathe that begins its turn inside of the smog can choose to hold its breath as a free action for the round, but if it doesn't, it becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. The _smogger_ can maintain this effect for up to 1 minute, and the wearer of the _smogger_ can Dismiss the effect.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` (poison) Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The _smogger's_ above activation is in effect  * * *  **Effect** The smog created by the _smogger_ thickens into a toxic element that burns the eyes, blisters flesh, and causes fits of coughing. All creatures in the smog cloud, including you, must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude check saveâ€”creatures that must breathe and aren't holding their breath take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is sickened 1.  **Failure** The creature is sickened 1 (or increases their sickened condition value to 2 if it isn't holding its breath). The creature also takes 4d6 poison damage.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes 8d6 poison damage."
