description: "**Perception** +11; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet  **Communication** speech (Common and four other common languages)  **Skills** Performance +15  **Int** +2, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +4  **Will** +13 (+17 against attempts to quiet its singing)  * * *  A _singing sword_ is a _+1 striking_ longsword imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A _singing sword_ can't stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful Diplomacy or Intimidation check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly. The _singing sword_ can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a _dancing_ weapon's activation, except that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for compositions.  **Activate—Courageous Anthem** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[Spells/Courageous Anthem|Courageous Anthem]].  **Activate—Rallying Anthem** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]].  **Activate—Counter Performance** `pf2:r` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory effect  * * *  **Effect** The _singing sword_ casts [[Spells/Counter Performance|Counter Performance]]."
