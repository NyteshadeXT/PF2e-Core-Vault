description: "These goggles use lenses made out of smoked glass to protect against creatures with gaze attacks. While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be [[Actions/Avert Gaze|Averting Your Gaze]], but all creatures have [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] from you.  The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the concealment from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either."
