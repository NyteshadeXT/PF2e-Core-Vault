description: "This clear crystal pendant contains a drop of blood from a sorcerer that expands and contracts as you cast spells. A sanguine pendant is associated with a specific sorcerer bloodline, and only sorcerers with that bloodline can invest this item. This item gains the trait matching the tradition of that bloodline. The pendant grants a +2 item bonus to both of your bloodline skills.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Blood's Call** `pf2:0` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a bloodline spell. If you don't spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it's lost.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You're a sorcerer with the associated bloodline."
