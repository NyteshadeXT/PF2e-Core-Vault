description: "This large magical parasol shields you from the heat in hot environments, no matter whether the heat comes from above, like the beating sun, or below, like roiling lava. While holding the _sparkshade parasol_, you gain resistance 10 to fire and are protected from mild, severe, and extreme environmental heat.  * * *  **Activate—Parasol's Protection** `pf2:r` (manipulate)  **Trigger** You're targeted by or inside the area of an effect that deals fire damage  **Frequency** once per 10 minutes  **Effect** You hold your parasol between yourself and the incoming flames, gaining fire resistance 20 against the triggering effect. (This applies only to any damage the effect deals.) For the next 1 minute, flames dance harmlessly along the parasol's brim, letting you use Parasol's Pyrotechnics.  * * *  **Activate—Parasol's Pyrotechnics** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Requirements** Flames are dancing on the _sparkshade parasol_ due to you using Parasol's Protection  **Effect** You release captured flames out from your parasol, shooting fire in a 30-foot line. Each creature in the line takes 10d6 fire damage (DC 28 Reflex check save). This activation loses its charge."
