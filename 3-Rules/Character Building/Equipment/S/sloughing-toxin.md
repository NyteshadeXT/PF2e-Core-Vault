Rough or jerky movements the victim performs concentrate the toxin in subdermal muscles and eventually cause skin and muscle to slough away.  * * *  **Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude check  **Onset** 1 round  **Maximum Duration** 1 hour  **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage for each action with the attack or move trait the victim uses (1 round)  **Stage 2** 1d6 poison damage and 1d6 slashing damage for each action with the attack, manipulate, or move trait the victim uses (1 round)  **Stage 3** as Stage 2, but 1d6 poison damage and 2d6 slashing damage, and forced movement also causes damage (1 hour)"
