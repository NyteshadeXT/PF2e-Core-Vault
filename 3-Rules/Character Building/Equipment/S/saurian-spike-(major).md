The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence.  *   **Armor** You gain precise scent with a range of 60 feet. *   **Weapon**(auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 60-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 34 Will check saving throw or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).
