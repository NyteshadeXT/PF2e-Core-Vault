description: "The shobhad longrifle is a firearm with a long, rifled barrel. Often mounted with a multi-lensed scope for targeting at an array of ranges and a chambering mechanism that can adjust the speed and penetrating power of each shot, it's the preferred weapon of many shobhad warriors.  Shobhad longrifles are equipped with a built-in [[Equipment/Silencer|Silencer]] so they make no more noise than a crossbow when fired.  A shobhad longrifle is a martial weapon."
