description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  On the Elemental Plane of Air, small clouds of differing colors can sometimes float separately from other cloud formations. Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, _spun clouds_ don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.  A blue cloud protects against lightning. Creatures gain resistance 5 to electricity while in the cloud.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Spun Cloud (Blue)|Effect: Spun Cloud (Blue)]]"
