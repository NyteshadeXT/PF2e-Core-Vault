description: "These soft slippers are made of fine gray silk. If the slippers are left unattended for a while, they tend to attract spiders that nest inside.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** Tiny, hairlike tendrils extend from the slippers' soles, allowing you to walk on vertical surfaces or even to move upside down along ceilings.  For 1 minute, you gain a 20-foot climb Speed and you don't need to use your hands to Climb. However, the slippers require decent traction for you to walk on a wall, so they provide no benefit when you're moving across greased, icy, or oiled surfaces.
