description: "Prized by naari geniekin who prefer to fight with their fists, _true scalding gauntlets_ are a pair of _+3 greater striking greater flaming spiked gauntlets_. The intricate golden gauntlets are engraved with Pyric writing praising the glories of the Dominion of Flame and embellished with shimmering black and red gemstones. A creature you grab or restrain while wearing the gauntlets must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude check save or take 4d6 persistent fire damage and be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the pain; it's temporarily immune to being sickened by _scalding gauntlets_ for 1 hour."
