description: "**Activate** Cast a Spell  * * *  This luminous mica dust fluoresces for a short time after being exposed to significant amounts of magical energy. When a creature fails its save against a cloud of [[Spells/Revealing Light|Revealing Light]] created using this catalyst, glowing grains stick to them, causing them to shed dim light in a 20-foot radius for as long as their invisibility is negated by the spell as well as causing them to take a -2 circumstance penalty to Stealth for that duration.
