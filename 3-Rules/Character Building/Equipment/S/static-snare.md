description: "You hide insulating crystals or other material that releases a strong static charge when the first creature enters the snare's square. That creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex check saving throw.  * * *  **Success** The target is unaffected.  **Failure** The target takes 1 persistent electricity damage and takes a -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against electricity effects for as long as the persistent electricity damage lasts.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Static Snare|Effect: Static Snare]]  **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target attracts nearby dirt and dust. If the target is or becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it's merely [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures that have sight as a precise sense. This effect lasts as long as the persistent electricity damage does."
