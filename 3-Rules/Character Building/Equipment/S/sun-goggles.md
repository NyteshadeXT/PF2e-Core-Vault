description: "These goggles are usually fitted with a polished piece of yellowtoned crystal, allowing the wearer some protection against the brightness of the sun. Near the Crown of the World, a version of these goggles exists where the crystal is replaced by thin slits, mitigating the effects of the sun's reflection on snow.  When wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects that could inflict the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition."
