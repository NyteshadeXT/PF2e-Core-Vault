description: "This suit of padded armor consists of a beautifully woven pleated tunic adorned with a gold pattern and narrow bands of white fur trim on a deep blue background with matching pants, all of which are meant to signal wealth and status. This +2 resilient raiment padded armor was custom designed for Alessandro Domenesso, an actor as well known for their astounding costume changes as for their roguish off-stage activities. Even without utilizing the magic of this armor, it's elegant enough that it could easily be mistaken as fine clothing.  **Activate—Look At Me!** `pf2:2` (concentrate, illusion, mental, visual)  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You make yourself visible and apparent to a creature you can see that's within 30 feet. The scene stealer's tunic transforms into something incredibly gaudy, distracting, or otherwise compelling to the target creature, who must attempt a DC 30 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target is distracted by you and keeps looking your way. They take a –1 status penalty to Perception checks against everything but you, a –1 status penalty to all saving throws against your visual effects, and gain a +2 status bonus to all saving throws against visual effects created by anyone else; these penalties and bonus last for 1 minute.  **Failure** As success, but the target is also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to everyone other than you as long as you remain visible.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target also becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as they spend extra time on their turn admiring, glowering, or otherwise being distracted by you.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Look at Me!|Effect: Look at Me!]]"
