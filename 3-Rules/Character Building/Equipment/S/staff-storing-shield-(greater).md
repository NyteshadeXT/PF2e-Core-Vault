description: "This magically _reinforced wooden shield_ normally has a blank face. It can absorb a staff and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a staff of necromancy.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You change the staff-storing shield from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.  * * *      | Hardness | HP | BT | | --- | --- | --- | | 9 | 54 | 27 |"
