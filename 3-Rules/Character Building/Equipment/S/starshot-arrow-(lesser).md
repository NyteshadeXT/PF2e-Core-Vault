description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  The metal of these arrows is said to have come from a star that ventured too close to Golarion and was shot down by a moonlit archer. When you activate and shoot a _starshot arrow_, you take no range penalties against any target that you can personally detect. There must be a line of effect between you and the target.  The target must be within the maximum range of your weapon."
