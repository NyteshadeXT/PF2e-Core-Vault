description: "Each of these full-face masks is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single, bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie and the mask doesn't impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.  * * *  This mask is made of gray and black tiles sewn together. It has a messy, inky spiral over the mouth.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (auditory, linguistic)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You touch the mask's spiral and identify a target creature within 30 feet. For the next 10 minutes, any normal speech you utter can, at your discretion, be inaudible to all creatures except the target creature, who can hear you clearly regardless of ambient sound so long as it is within 1 mile. This ability doesn't silence magical words, such as the verbal component of spellcasting or commands to activate magic items."
