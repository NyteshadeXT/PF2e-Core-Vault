description: "The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.  **Activateâ€”Outline** `pf2:1` (auditory, light, manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while they glow. If a creature is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], they're concealed while glowing, rather than being undetected. Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the ghost touch property rune."
