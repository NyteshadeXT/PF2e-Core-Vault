description: "The spider lily tattoo marks you as a trusted member of Granny Hu's network. This crimson tattoo fades and becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] within a day of being applied, reappearing only when you Activate it, when you gain the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition, or when you die. The higher the doomed value, the more vivid the color.  If your tattoo is plainly visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks against all creatures that can see the tattoo, but you take a –1 item penalty to Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on those who understand the actual meaning of the spider lily tattoo (including all of Willowshore's citizens).  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision (concentrate)  **Requirements** Your tattoo isn't currently visible  **Effect** You make the tattoo visible. You can use this activation again to make the tattoo not visible, unless you have the doomed condition.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** An undead creature detects you for the first time  **Effect** The spider lily tattoo manipulates your life force to make you appear to be undead for a short time. Attempt a Deception check check against the triggering undead creature's Perception DC. On a success, the triggering undead believes you're undead as well—a mindless undead is likely to ignore you, while a sapient undead might react with curiosity or confusion. You can continue attempting Deception checks each round as a single action to Sustain the effect for up to 1 minute."
