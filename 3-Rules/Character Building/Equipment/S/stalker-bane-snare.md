description: "This snare explodes in a burst of cloying powder that can cling to a creature stepping into its square. A creature that enters the square of a stalker bane snare must attempt a DC 20 Reflex check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** Powder sticks to the target, causing it to leave behind telltale footprints. Being [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] makes the target [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], to creatures that could see it if it weren't invisible.  **Failure** Powder clumps on the target, constantly flaking away. Being invisible makes the target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], rather than hidden or undetected, to creatures that could see it if it weren't invisible.  **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn."
