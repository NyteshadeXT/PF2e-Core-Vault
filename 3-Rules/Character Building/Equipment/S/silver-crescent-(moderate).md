description: "A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the undead. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a torch, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against olfactory effects. While shedding this light, you can't be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being undetected.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Silver Crescent|Effect: Silver Crescent]]  * * *  **Secondary Effect** `pf2:2`  **Effect** A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes 7d6 vitality with a DC 28 Reflex check and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert."
