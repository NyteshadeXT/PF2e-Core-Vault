description: "**Ammunition** any  **Activate** `pf2:2` Cast a Spell  * * *  Mystic patterns create a magic reservoir within this ammunition. You activate _spellstrike ammunition_ by Casting a Spell into the ammunition. The spell must be of a spell rank the ammunition can hold, and the spell must be able to target a creature other than the caster. A creature hit by activated _spellstrike ammunition_ is targeted by the spell. If the creature isn't a valid target for the spell, the spell is lost.  The ammunition affects only the target hit, even if the spell would normally affect more than one target. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, use the result of your ranged attack roll with the ammunition to determine the degree of success of the spell. If the spell requires a saving throw, the target attempts the save against your spell DC.  The maximum rank of spell the ammunition can hold determines its item level and Price.  Maximum Spell Rank 2nd"
