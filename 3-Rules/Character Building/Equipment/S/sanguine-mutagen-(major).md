description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  For 1 hour you gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.  **Benefit** You gain a +4 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. When you roll a success on a save against a disease, poison, or effect that would give you the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition, you get a critical success instead and your critical failures on such saves become failures instead.  **Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
