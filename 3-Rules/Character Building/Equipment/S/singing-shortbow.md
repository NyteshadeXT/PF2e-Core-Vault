description: "Rather than a normal bowstring, this _+2 greater striking thundering composite shortbow_ has a string made of animal gut, much like a musical instrument's. When you shoot the bow, it releases a soft musical note: sonorous if your aim is true and discordant if your shot goes off-target.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command (auditory)  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You sing, hum, or whistle a note, and your bow provides appropriate accompaniment. Make a Strike with the bow. If it hits, the bow generates a magical effect determined by the note you sung, which has the traits indicated in parentheses. This affects every creature in a 10-foot emanation from the creature you hit. As normal for an emanation, you choose whether the creature you hit is affected.  *   **Song of Soothing** (emotion, enchantment, healing, mental) Each creature regains 3d10 healing Hit Points and gains a +1 status bonus to saves against mental effects for 1 minute. *   **Song of Suffering** (evocation, sonic) Each creature takes 3d10 sonic damage with a DC 31 Fortitude check save."
