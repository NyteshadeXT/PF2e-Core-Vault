description: "This _+3 greater striking kukri_ has a thin, delicate blade that absorbs light.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (illusion, teleportation)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You make a melee Strike with shadow's heart and teleport to an open space you can see within 100 feet. If the attack hits, you also leave behind a shadowy, illusory duplicate of yourself that attacks the same target for up to 3 rounds. The illusion has 1 action per round, which it takes on the turn it's created and on your turn each round. It uses this action to move up to 30 feet to a square adjacent to the target and (if the target is adjacent) to attack the target with a +28 attack modifier, dealing 3d6+16 slashing damage. The illusion has an AC of 35 and is immediately destroyed by any attack that deals damage or requires a saving throw."
