description: "This impressive-looking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag. Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as iron.  Rather than restrict the senses, a _stag's helm_ enhances them, causing the world to appear in more vibrant colors and significantly enhancing the ambient sounds of the region without making them distracting. While worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to Perception checks.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0`  **Frequency** once per day (or once per hour if the wearer worships [[Deities/Erastil|Erastil]])  **Effect** Choose a single creature within 30 feet. The _stag's helm_ focuses your aim and grants supernatural insight into your next shot. Your target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the next ranged Strike you make this turn against them.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Stag's Helm|Effect: Stag's Helm]]"
