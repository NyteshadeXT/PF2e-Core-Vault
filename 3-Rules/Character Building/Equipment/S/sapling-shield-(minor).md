description: "This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden buckler (Hardness 3, HP 24, and BT 12) is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  * * *  **Effect** The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a tower shield, gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]]. It keeps the same Hit Points and Broken Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler."
