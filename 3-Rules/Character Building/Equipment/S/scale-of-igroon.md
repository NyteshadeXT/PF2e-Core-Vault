description: "Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A scale of Igroon (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]], you can use the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction with the _scale of Igroon_ to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Requirements** You're in an area of bright or dim light  * * *  **Effect** You angle the shield to refract light. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] and can do so while observed. This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Requirements** You're in an area of bright light  * * *  **Effect** You angle the shield at a target within 60 feet, reflecting light into its eyes. It must attempt a DC 42 Fortitude check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until its next turn begins.  **Failure** The target is blinded for 1 minute.  **Critical Failure** The target is blinded for 2d4 hours.  **Activate** `pf2:0` Interact  **Trigger** You use Shield Block and prevent yourself from taking energy damage from a line, ray, or a direct attack, including a magic missile spell  * * *  **Effect** You reflect the energy along a trajectory you choose. The effect travels only up to its remaining range, using its original parameters if it strikes other targets.  **Destruction** If a deity, kaiju, spawn of a deity, titan, or being of similar power stomps on a scale of Igroon while in absolute darkness, the shield is destroyed permanently."
