description: "A _spellstriker staff_ is wrought iron with gleaming arcane sigils etched into its surface and a sharp point at the bottom. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+2 striking shifting staff_.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You use Spellstrike with a non-cantrip spell and miss with the Strike  **Effect** An explosion of magical energy—stored up for the Spellstrike—explodes out. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation take 1d6 damage per rank of the spell, with a Reflex check save against your spell DC. This damage is the same type the spell would have dealt, and the activation gains that trait; if the spell would have dealt multiple types of damage, choose one of them. If the damage of the explosion is mental, the save is Will check instead of Reflex.  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Echoing Weapon|Echoing Weapon]], [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/Acid Arrow|Acid Arrow]], [[Spells/Telekinetic Maneuver|Telekinetic Maneuver]] *   **3rd** [[Spells/Echoing Weapon|Echoing Weapon]], [[Spells/Haste|Haste]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Acid Arrow|Acid Arrow]], [[Spells/Weapon Storm|Weapon Storm]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You have the magus's Spellstrike activity. Supply one casting of all listed ranks of all listed spells."
