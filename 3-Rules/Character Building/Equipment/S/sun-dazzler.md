description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  This metallic tube has a complex array of lenses and prisms at one end and a hatch at the other. The hatch can be unlocked, loaded with a [[Equipment/Glow Rod|Sunrod]], and refastened using 3 Interact actions. A loaded sun dazzler can be activated to burn the sunrod to dust in a single focused flash, creating a 30-foot cone of scintillating light. All creatures in the cone must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude check save, with the following effects.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round or until it spends an Interact action to rub its eyes, ending the blinded condition.  **Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 round."
