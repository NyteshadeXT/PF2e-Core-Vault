description: "Sacs full of dark ink have been implanted inside your mouth, allowing you to spit it forth.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Spray Ink** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You splatter ink in a 10-foot cone, covering creatures and revealing [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] ones. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex check save or become covered in ink. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this ink, it is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead of invisible. A creature can negate the effects of the ink by spending two Interact actions to wipe off the ink.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.  **Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round. Its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.  **Critical Failure** The target is blinded for 10 minutes. Its invisibility is negated for 10 minutes.  * * *  If this graft is used underwater, you can instead choose to release the ink in a 10-foot emanation. The resulting ink cloud lasts for 10 minutes. All creatures in the ink cloud become concealed, and all creatures outside the ink cloud become concealed to creatures within it."
