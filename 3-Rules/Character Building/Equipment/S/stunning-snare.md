description: "You rig a snare to disorient a creature with a quick bash, leaving it with little ability to defend itself. The trap deals 10d6 bludgeoning damage to the first creature to enter its square; that creature must attempt a DC 32 Reflex check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].  **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is off-guard for 1 round and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]].  **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is off-guard for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 4]]."
