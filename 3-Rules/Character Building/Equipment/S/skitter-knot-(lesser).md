description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You are [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] at the beginning of your turn.  * * *  Carved from an arboreal's knuckle, this wooden torus can be activated despite your being [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. The knot then sprouts several roots that arch over your body like a spider's legs. These lift you a few inches off the ground before Striding and carrying you with them. The roots prioritize taking you away from obvious harm, though as a reaction, an ally who speaks Arboreal can command the roots to carry you to a particular point within range.  After moving, the roots continue protecting you; this counts as Raising a Shield, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. The roots use the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction against the first physical attack against you, after which the roots crumble.  The roots carry you up to 10 feet and have Hardness 5."
