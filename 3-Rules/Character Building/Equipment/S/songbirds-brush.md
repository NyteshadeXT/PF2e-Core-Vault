description: "The blade of this _+2 greater striking holy glaive_ shimmers with a prismatic sheen, as if faintly reflecting a rainbow. A _songbird's brush_ sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 40 feet). When wielded in combat, the sound of the blade cutting through the air creates a soft, musical trill as if produced by a songbird. Sacred to the faithful of Shelyn, a _songbird's brush_ is so named for the fighting style developed by worshippers of the Eternal Rose, which equates its sweeping swings to painting with a brush. A _songbird's brush_ grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks made to dance or sing as long as the glaive is held in two hands.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You sweep the _songbird's brush_ in an arc before you, casting [[Spells/Prismatic Spray|Prismatic Spray]] from the glaive. The spell DC is 34. This _prismatic spray_ does not affect good-aligned creatures in its area.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You are a worshipper of Shelyn."
