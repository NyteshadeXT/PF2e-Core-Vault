description: "The blade of this _+2 greater striking adamantine longsword_ seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature.  While _Spellcutter_ is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to dhampirs or creatures with the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]] ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Trigger** You're targeted by a spell while wielding _Spellcutter_  **Effect** _Spellcutter_ attempts to absorb the magic of the triggering spell, giving you a +4 status bonus to your AC and saves against the effect.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Effect** Touching _Spellcutter_ to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-rank spells with the light trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact."
