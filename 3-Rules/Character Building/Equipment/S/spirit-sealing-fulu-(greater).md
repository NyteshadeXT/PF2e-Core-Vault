description: "**Usage** affixed to one undead creature  **Duration** 1 round or 4 rounds  * * *  This classic fulu seals the void energy within an undead, freezing it in its tracks. Upon affixing, the target undead must attempt a DC 27 Will check save or be [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the undead is paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success."
