Sigils and runes of ancient and powerful magic cover the iron cladding on this long wooden staff. A _staff of the magi_ is a _+3 major striking staff_, and when wielding it you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells.

Voluntarily destroying a _staff of the magi_ unleashes a truly devastating wave of arcane energy that surges out, dissipating with distance. When wielding the staff, you can break it using an Interact action. This releases a @Template\[burst|distance:30\] magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d10 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 Reflex check). You automatically critically fail your save. The explosion continues to echo beyond the initial blast zone, dealing half as much damage to creatures beyond 30 feet but within a @Template\[burst|distance:60\]. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a death effect.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

**Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
