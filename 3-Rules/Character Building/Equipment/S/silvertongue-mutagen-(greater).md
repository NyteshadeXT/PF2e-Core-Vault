description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Your features become striking, and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though emotion clouds your reason.  **Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation and Performance checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.  **Drawback** You take a -2 item penalty to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.  **Duration** 1 hour.
