description: "A silver charm bracelet, a sluggish bracelet appears to be a bracelet of dashing, granting you a +1 item bonus to Acrobatics checks. If the curse goes unrecognized, you think you can Activate it to gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute. Instead, its activation is as follows.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  * * *  **Effect** You take a –10-foot penalty to your Speed for 1 minute, and the bracelet fuses to you. Thereafter, it grants you no bonus to Acrobatics checks, and it imposes a –5-foot status penalty to your Speed."
