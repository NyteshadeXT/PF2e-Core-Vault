# Silver Crescent (Moderate)
## Item 11
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[3-Rules/Trait Reference/L/light]][[lozenge]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 235 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the undead. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a torch, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against olfactory effects. While shedding this light, you can't be [[3-Rules/Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[Invisible|Invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being undetected.

**Secondary Effect** `pf2:2`

**Effect** A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes 7d6 vitality with a DC 28 Reflex check and is [[Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.
