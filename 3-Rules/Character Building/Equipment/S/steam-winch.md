description: "This hefty winch is powered by a small steam engine and includes a 100-foot length of steel cable, which enables you to haul a heavier load than you could with a hand cranked winch or comealong. A steam winch allows you to slowly pull a heavy load (usually up to 50 Bulk) along a flat surface or up and down a vertical expanse.  Attaching a steam winch to a device takes three Interact actions, while starting the winch (and getting it warm enough to operate) takes 10 minutes. Once in operation, a steam winch requires regular maintenance to function. Every 20 minutes, the boiler must be refilled and heat levels maintained."
