description: "On Tekritanin holidays, children reenacted legendary battles of deities by playing with magical tops. Though the paint on this wooden top has long since faded, its magical runes once gleamed yellow-gold and fiery orange, evoking the color of the sky during a sandstorm. To set the top in motion, wind a string around its bottom and upward along its body, and then throw it while gripping the string.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You throw the sandstorm top 10 feet away from you. For 1 minute, as it spins, the top generates a magical sandstorm in a 5-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 30 Reflex check save). Additionally, a creature within the sandstorm must hold its breath or begin suffocating."
