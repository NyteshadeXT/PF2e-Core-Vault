description: "These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beastâ€”a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Standard of the Primeval Howl|Effect: Standard of the Primeval Howl]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** An ally within 20 feet of you critically hits with a Strike  **Requirements** You have the [[Feats/Battle Cry|Battle Cry]] skill feat  **Effect** You attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the foe the Strike hit."
