description: "Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a _spike launcher_ is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A _spike launcher_ is a _+1 striking_ weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.  * * *  **Activate—Spike Shot** `pf2:3` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The _spike launcher_ is loaded  **Effect** The _spike launcher_ fires a volley of spikes in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range. Make a Strike with the _spike launcher_ against each creature in the area; your multiple attack penalty does not increase until after you have resolved all these attacks. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the tail of a manticore."
