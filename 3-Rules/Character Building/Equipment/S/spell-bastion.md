description: "A _spell-bastion_ rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the shield. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect-it's instead stored for later. When you invest a _spell-bastion_ shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A _spell-bastion_ shield found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Requirements** Your _spell-bastion_ shield is storing a spell, and you have your shield raised  * * *  **Effect** You prepare to unleash the stored spell on any foe that hits you until your next turn.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` command  **Requirements** You have a spell stored in your _spell-bastion_ shield, and you've activated the shield since your last turn in preparation for unleashing the spell  **Trigger** You use the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction against a foe that the stored spell can target  * * *  **Effect** You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell. This empties the spell from the shield and allows a spell to be cast into it again.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  * * *  **Effect** You harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the shield to have a new spell cast into it."
