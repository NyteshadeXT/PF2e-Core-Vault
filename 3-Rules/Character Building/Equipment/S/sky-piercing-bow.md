description: "This shortbow is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. Its compact size and power make it a favorite of mounted archers. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a shortbow, it also applies to composite shortbows unless otherwise stated.  Large turquoise gems stud the outer edge of this sturdy +3 greater striking ghost touch composite shortbow. Arrows shot from the bow are unimpaired by wind and air effects.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact (conjuration, teleportation)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You shoot an arrow at an open space on a surface within 500 feet and momentarily vanish into a wind that carries the arrow. You teleport to that location.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact (electricity)  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You shoot an arrow at the sky and it tears an extraplanar rift that resembles a storm cloud in a 30-foot burst centered on a point within 200 feet. A torrent of rain pours down from the rift for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the effect. The area within the torrent becomes difficult terrain for all movement (including Flying). As an Interact action, you can fire an arrow into the rift to cause a bolt of lightning to strike a creature in the area. The creature takes 5d12 electricity damage and must attempt a DC 41 Reflex check save.  * * *  **Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact)  **Frequency** once per week  * * *  **Effect** You fire a volley of arrows into the sky. You create the effects of a successful [[Spells/Control Weather|Control Weather]] ritual."
