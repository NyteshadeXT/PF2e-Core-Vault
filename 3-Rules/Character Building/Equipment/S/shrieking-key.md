description: "A skull-topped metal _shrieking key_ appears to be a _[[Equipment/Skeleton Key|Skeleton Key]]_, useful in place of _[[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit|Thieves' Tools]]_ when attempting to Pick a Lock. A _shrieking key_ has no activation, however. When you use it to Pick a Lock, the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the Thievery check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your possession if discarded. To use another device to Pick a Lock, you must first succeed at a DC 20 Will check save."
