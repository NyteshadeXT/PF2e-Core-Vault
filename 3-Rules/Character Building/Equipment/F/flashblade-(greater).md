description: "A sleek and impossibly lightweight blade attached to a haft scriven with lightning bolts make up this _+2 greater striking nodachi_.  **Activateâ€”Prepare Flash** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per 10 minutes  * * *  **Effect** You concentrate with complete focus on your surroundings, breathing in the flashblade's magic to make you lighter and faster, and the blade of your sword more flexible. You Ready a melee Strike, increasing the flashblade's reach for that Strike to 20 feet. If the trigger doesn't occur, this doesn't count against the flashblade's frequency."
