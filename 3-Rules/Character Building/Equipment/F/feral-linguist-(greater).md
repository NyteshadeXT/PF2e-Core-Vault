description: "**Activate** Cast a Spell (add 1 action)  * * *  This wooden whistle is stuffed with cotton and carved with images of bellowing stags, howling wolves, and chirping birds. You can blow on this whistle to use it as a catalyst when casting an [[Spells/Animal Form|Animal Form]] spell. When you do, you retain the ability to speak.  Once during the spell's duration, you can cast either a spell of 4th-rank or lower or a cantrip of any level, ignoring the inability to cast spells while in your battle form."
