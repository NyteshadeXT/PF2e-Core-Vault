description: "Originally developed as a body modification by oreads, _fleshgems_ are crystals that can be implanted in the skin of a creature of any ancestry. While a _fleshgem_ can be applied anywhere on the body for cosmetic purposes, the most common usage among adventurers is to implant them at the base of the fingers, to be used like brass knuckles.  You siphon your _fleshgem's_ power, and the earth around you erupts in crystal stalagmites.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` to `pf2:2` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** You are standing on the ground  * * *  **Effect** The ground around you erupts in a 10-foot burst of knee-high crystal shards that remain for 1 round, or 1 minute if you spent two actions. To all creatures other than you, the area is difficult terrain as well as hazardous terrain. Creatures that move through a space containing crystal shards take 2 piercing damage."
