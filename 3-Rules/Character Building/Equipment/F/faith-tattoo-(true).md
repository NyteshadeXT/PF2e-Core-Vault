description: "**Prerequisites** worshipper of a deity, alignment matching the deity's follower alignments  * * *  You have marked your body to show your devotion to a deity. This tattoo could be the deity's religious symbol, another image that evokes that deity, or another mark you gained through your devotion. The tattoo serves as a silver religious symbol of the deity. Provided you keep the tattoo uncovered, you need not wield it to gain that benefit. If you cease meeting the prerequisites, the tattoo fades, and you lose its benefits until you perform an [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual and meet the prerequisites thereafter.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The tattoo casts 7th-rank [[Spells/Harm|Harm]], 7th-rank [[Spells/Heal|Heal]], or the 7th-rank spell from your deity's cleric spells. You can choose harm or heal only in accord with the deity's divine font. If the deity allows either spell, choose one the tattoo can cast when you receive the tattoo. The DC for any of these spells is 35. Also, the tattoo has as a trait the school of the spell the tattoo can cast.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** silver worth 2 gp to include in the ink"
