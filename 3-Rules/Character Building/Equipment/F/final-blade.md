description: "A Large or smaller restrained or willing creature can be executed by a final blade.  * * *  **Activate** 1 minute (Interact)  * * *  **Effect** You execute a creature restrained beneath the blade. The creature you execute takes 11d10 slashing damage and must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude check save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a _+3 major striking vorpal scythe_. The soul of a creature executed with a final blade is trapped, and the creature can't be returned to life, not even by miracle or similar magic. A final blade can hold any number of souls in this way, and a sufficient number of captured souls forms a monster called a gray death.  **Destruction** A final blade can be destroyed via the rare ritual, blunt the final blade."
