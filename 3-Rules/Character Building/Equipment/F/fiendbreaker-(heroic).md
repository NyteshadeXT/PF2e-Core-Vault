description: "**Perception** +35; precise low-light vision and hearing within 30 feet  **Communication** telepathy (partner only)  **Skills** Demon Lore +33, Diplomacy +34, Religion +35  **Int** +5, **Wis** +7, **Cha** +6  **Will** +35  * * *  The stately echo of Jininsiel, the woman who guided her people through the Darklands to escape the devastation of Earthfall, causes _Fiendbreaker_ to softly shimmer with a silvery radiance equivalent to that of candlelight. _Fiendbreaker_ can activate or deactivate this radiance as a free action once per round on her partner's turn. _Fiendbreaker's_ telepathic voice is calm and soothing, seeking to support her partner's decisions with compliments or warnings against overconfidence as needed.  _Fiendbreaker_ functions as a _+3 major striking holy high-grade cold iron staff_. While wielding the staff, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about any sort of fiend.  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per round  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from her list. _Fiendbreaker_ can use this activation only if you're holding the staff and only if you haven't used _Fiendbreaker_ to Cast a Spell this round. Likewise, if _Fiendbreaker_ Casts a Spell from the staff, you can't activate the staff to Cast a Spell this round.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Divine Lance|Divine Lance]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Sanctuary|Sanctuary]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] *   **3rd** [[Spells/Anointed Ground|Anointed Ground]], [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Clear Mind|Clear Mind]], [[Spells/Planar Tether|Planar Tether]] *   **5th** [[Spells/Banishment|Banishment]], [[Spells/Divine Wrath|Divine Wrath]] *   **6th** [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]], [[Spells/Spirit Blast|Spirit Blast]] *   **7th** [[Spells/Divine Decree|Divine Decree]], [[Spells/Planar Seal|Planar Seal]] *   **8th** [[Spells/Divine Wrath|Divine Wrath]], [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]] *   **9th** [[Spells/Banishment|Banishment]], [[Spells/Divine Decree|Divine Decree]]  * * *  **Activateâ€”Restore Mind** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** _Fiendbreaker_ attempts to counteract an ongoing mental affect you're suffering from, with a counteract rank of 9th and a +25 modifier to the roll (or a +30 modifier if the source of the mental effect on you was created by a fiend)."
