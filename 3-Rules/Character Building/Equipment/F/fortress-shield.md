description: "Also known as portable walls, these thick and heavy shields are slightly larger than tower shields. Like tower shields, they're typically made from wood reinforced with metal, but many are made from larger amounts of metal or even stone.  Getting the higher bonus for this shield requires using the [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] action while the shield is raised."
