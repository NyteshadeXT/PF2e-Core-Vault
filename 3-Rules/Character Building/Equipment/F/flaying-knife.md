description: "This long, thin +1 striking [[Equipment/Wounding|Wounding]] dagger has a smooth edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other.  Its persistent bleed damage comes from slicing away long strips of the target's flesh, and it deals 1d8 bleed on a hit instead of 1d6. A creature takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against diseases for as long as it has persistent bleed damage from this knife."
