description: "This unassuming hooded lantern contains a mass of flash beetle eggs suspended in a magical solution.

The eggs brighten and emit a series of brilliant flashes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area of effect must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.  **Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the eggs of a flash beetle."
