description: "You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you Stride, you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become _paralyzed_ for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast dimension _door._ The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing 2d6 spirit damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces."
