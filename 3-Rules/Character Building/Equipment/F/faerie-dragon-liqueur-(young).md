description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Each draft of faerie dragon liqueur has a different flavor. For 1 hour after you drink it, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of euphoric gas. Each creature in the cone must attempt a DC 23 Will check save. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1d4 rounds.  **Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and slowed 1 for 1 minute."
