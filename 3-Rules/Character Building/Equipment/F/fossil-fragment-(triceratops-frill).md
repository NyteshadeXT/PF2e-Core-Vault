description: "A fossil fragment is a piece of a fossil creature, typically a smaller bone from a larger specimen.  **Activateâ€”Fossil Metamorphosis** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** You activate the fragment by placing it on solid ground and then speaking its name, causing the fragment to form the full fossilized skeleton of a creature. In creature form, the fragment has the minion trait. Because it's an animated fossil instead of a living creature, it has the construct and earth traits and lacks its normal creature type trait (typically animal). It's also immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], healing, nonlethal attacks, [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], poison, sickened, vitality, void, and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. It can understand your language, and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency, if any, appear in its entry below.  * * *  This small piece of triceratops frill turns into a [[Monster Core/Triceratops|Triceratops]] when activated. It can be called upon once per day and can remain in triceratops form for no more than 10 minutes. The skeleton can serve as a mount for a creature one size smaller than it or smaller."
