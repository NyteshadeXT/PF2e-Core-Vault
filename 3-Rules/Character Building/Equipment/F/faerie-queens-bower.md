It refuses access to its magic to anyone who causes undue harm to plants or animals. In addition to the features and activation of autumn's embrace, faerie queen's bower has the following activation.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The armor casts 4th-rank [[Spells/Safe Passage|Safe Passage]], with the protected area beginning from your square and extending to a place of relative safety.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision (aura)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You call forth a storm of leaves from _autumn's embrace_.
