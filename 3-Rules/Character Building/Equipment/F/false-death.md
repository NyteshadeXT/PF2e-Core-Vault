description: "Typically used to fake one's death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the unconscious target must succeed at a Medicine check against the imbiber's Deception DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste (DC 10 Perception check to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude check  **Onset** 10 minutes  **Maximum Duration** 5 days  **Stage 1** [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] (1 round)  **Stage 2** [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (1 hour)  **Stage 3** unconscious (1 day)"
