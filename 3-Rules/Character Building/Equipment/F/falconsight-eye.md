description: "This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the _magical prosthetic eye_, it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from â€“2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] condition."
