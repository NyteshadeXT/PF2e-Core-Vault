description: "This exquisite fiddle is perfectly carved and balanced to produce the purest sound while granting its player perfect balance and poise. It grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks. If you're a master in Performance, while playing it you also gain a +1 status bonus to Reflex saves and a +1 item bonus to Dexterity-based skill checks. If you're legendary in Performance, the bonuses are +2.  When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] with the fiddle, you can choose to create a harsh and discordant note. You critically fail the Performance check, shred the strings of the fiddle, and create an 8th-rank [[Spells/Noise Blast|Noise Blast]], with a 40-foot emanation around you instead of a 10-foot burst. The fiddle can't be played again until the strings are replaced at a cost of 200 gp.  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from this instrument to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrips** [[Spells/Light|Light]], [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]], [[Spells/Message|Message]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Command|Command]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/Calm|Calm]], [[Spells/Faerie Fire|Faerie Fire]] *   **3rd** [[Spells/Enthrall|Enthrall]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Honeyed Words|Honeyed Words]] *   **5th** [[Spells/Sending|Sending]] *   **6th** [[Spells/Calm|Calm]], [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]], [[Spells/Vibrant Pattern|Vibrant Pattern]] *   **7th** [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]], [[Spells/Prismatic Spray|Prismatic Spray]], [[Spells/True Target|True Target]], [[Spells/Vibrant Pattern|Vibrant Pattern]], [[Spells/Visions of Danger|Visions of Danger]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed ranks of all listed spells."
