description: "You carefully pack rare, heat-absorbing powders into a specially prepared clay vessel, then bury the vessel in the ground up to its neck. When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a DC 20 Reflex check save to avoid getting powder in its face. A creature [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] by the powder can use an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Flat check check; on a success, it removes the condition. On a failure, it can try again, with a DC 5 Flat check check on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is dazzled for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is blinded until the end of its next turn and dazzled for 1 minute afterwards.  **Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and dazzled for 10 minutes afterwards."
