description: "**Usage** affixed to armor  **Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  * * *  This piece of bronzite is shaped like an oval with points at both ends. It has a carved flame at its center and is traditionally worn over the heart. You can activate only one _flame navette_ per day. When you activate the navette, you gain the benefit of the fighter's [[Feats/Determination|Determination]] class feat, with a counteract rank of 8 and a counteract modifier of +22.  If you have the Determination feat, you can use your own modifier if it's better."
