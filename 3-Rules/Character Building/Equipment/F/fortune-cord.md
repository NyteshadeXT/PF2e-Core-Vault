description: "In many parts of Tian Xia, it's tradition to mint coins with holes in the centers for the purpose of being able to thread a cord through them and tie them off for security and ease of transaction. This immaculately braided red cord is made in this tradition and can hold up to 100 coins at any given time. As long as you carry a fortune cord, you gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]].  If you load up to 100 coins onto a _fortune cord_ as part of your daily preparations, you can Activate the magic item in two different ways until the next time you make your daily preparations, provided all the loaded coins are of the same type.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** you have at least 50 coins loaded onto the _fortune cord_  **Effect** You transform the _fortune cord_ into a _+2 striking nunchaku_ for 1 minute. The type of coin loaded onto the cord determines the additional weapon property rune that manifests on this _+2 striking nunchaku_, as follows.  **Copper:** [[Equipment/Corrosive|Corrosive]] weapon  **Silver:** [[Equipment/Shock|Shock]] weapon  **Gold:** [[Equipment/Flaming|Flaming]] weapon  **Platinum:** [[Equipment/Frost|Frost]] weapon  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` manipulate, Interact  **Effect** You whip the fortune cord, causing 10 coins loaded onto it to detach and fire at a creature within 100 feet that you can see. That creature takes 4d6 damage (DC 28 Reflex check save); the damage type depends on the type of coins you've loaded. Copper coins deal 4d6 acid damage, silver coins deal 4d6 electricity damage, gold coins deal 4d6 fire damage, and platinum coins deal 4d6 cold damage."
