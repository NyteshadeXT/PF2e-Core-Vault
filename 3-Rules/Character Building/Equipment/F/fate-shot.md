description: "**Ammunition** any  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  * * *  Fate shot is made of a nickel-steel alloy carved with the smiling face of a comedic player on one side, while the other side holds the frown of a tragic dramatist. When you hit a target with this ammunition, roll a DC 11 Flat check. On a success, treat all the damage dice for your attack as though they rolled the average damage +1, rounded up (for example, a fate shot arrow fired from a shortbow would normally deal 1d6, which has an average of 3.5, so you deal 5 damage). This doesn't affect additional damage dice that only happen on a critical hit, such as those added by the deadly trait. On a failure, roll the damage, but your target takes half damage, and you take the remaining amount as mental damage."
