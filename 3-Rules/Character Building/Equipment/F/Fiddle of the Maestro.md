# Fiddle of the Maestro
## Item 16
### [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[coda]][[occult|Occult]][[3-Rules/Trait Reference/S/staff|Staff]]


**Price** 10000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This exquisite fiddle is perfectly carved and balanced to produce the purest sound while granting its player perfect balance and poise. It grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks. If you're a master in Performance, while playing it you also gain a +1 status bonus to Reflex saves and a +1 item bonus to Dexterity-based skill checks. If you're legendary in Performance, the bonuses are +2.

When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] with the fiddle, you can choose to create a harsh and discordant note. You critically fail the Performance check, shred the strings of the fiddle, and create an 8th-rank [[Noise Blast|Noise Blast]], with a @Template\[emanation|distance:40\] around you instead of a @Template\[burst|distance:10\]. The fiddle can't be played again until the strings are replaced at a cost of 200 gp.
