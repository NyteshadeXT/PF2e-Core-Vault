description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  Fiery Anulite paprika, sunrise cinnamon, and winterbite are hidden inside this salad's translucent leaves, bringing the cool of snow and the heat of steam to every bite. The dueling sensations make some diners sweat and others shiver, but all leave with a lasting sense of heat and cold that make other sources pale in comparison. When you consume the salad, you gain resistance 15 to fire and cold for 10 minutes.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Fire and Iceberg (Major)|Effect: Fire and Iceberg (Major)]]"
