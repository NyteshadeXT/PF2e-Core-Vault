description: "**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  * * *  Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.  * * *  The beacon shines bright light in a 180-foot radius and dim light in the next 180 feet. Creatures within a 30-foot radius of the beacon must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude check save or be dazzled until they are no longer within 30 feet of it. Additionally, on a critical failure, they are also blinded for 1 round."
