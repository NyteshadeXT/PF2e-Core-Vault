description: "This _+4 major striking holy morningstar_ is made of wood and adorned with golden flames traced along its haft and head. It has the razing trait, and it ignores the Hardness of structures used to hold those you feel are being unjustly imprisoned (subject to the GM's discretion).  * * *  **Activate—Break Free** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; _Freedom's Flame_ blazes with a rose-red light, creating a beacon of spiritual strength. Any creature within 120 feet that's currently under a compulsion or control effect can immediately attempt a new saving throw to break free of the effect, with a +3 status bonus.  * * *  **Activate—Holy Retribution** `pf2:0` (concentrate, divine)  **Trigger** Your previous action was to use _Freedom's Flame_ to Strike a foe you have witnessed use a compulsion or control effect on an ally within the past hour  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; your blow is empowered by the righteousness of [[Deities/Milani|Milani]]. The target's holy weakness is triggered again or, if the target doesn't have a holy weakness, it takes 15 spirit damage.  * * *  **Destruction** _Freedom's Flame_ is sliced in two if struck by a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]] that has been anointed with [[Equipment/Unholy Water|Unholy Water]] created by a level 20 unholy creature."
