description: "To get a _faith tattoo_ you must be a worshipper of a deity. You have marked your body to show your devotion to a deity. This tattoo could be the deity's religious symbol, another image that evokes that deity, or another mark you gained through your devotion. The tattoo serves as a silver religious symbol of the deity. Provided you keep the tattoo uncovered, you need not wield it to gain that benefit. If you cease meeting the prerequisites, the tattoo fades, and you lose its benefits until you perform an [[Atone]] ritual and meet the prerequisites thereafter."

Also, the tattoo has as a trait the school of the spell the tattoo can cast."
