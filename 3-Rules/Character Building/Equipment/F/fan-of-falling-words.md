description: "This folding handheld paper fan appears blank when first found, but if the wielder unfolds its leaves as an Interact action, they display an ink-brush painting of the wielder's choice. The fan must be closed and opened again to display a different painting. While held, the _fan of falling words_ grants you a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to act or perform comedy, orate, or sing.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You manifest the tapestry of your words, causing the image you depict on the fan to leap off its leaves. The fan casts [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]] to your specifications (DC 27 Will check save to disbelieve). While this only takes three actions to perform (as opposed to the spell's normal 10 minutes of casting), the effect has no range, and the 50-foot burst it creates is centered on you."
