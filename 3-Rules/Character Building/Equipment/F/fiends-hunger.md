description: "The blade of this _+1 low-grade silver dagger_ has a sickly red tinge. Though once used to send souls to empower Kugaptee, the fury of those slain by the blade now allow its wielder to periodically strike back against fiends.  **Activate** `pf2:0` command (divine, enchantment, mental)  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You score a critical hit against a fiend  * * *  **Effect** Vengeful echoes of the fallen lance out into the psyche of the fiend struck. After the normal effects of the critical hit, the target must roll a DC 18 Fortitude check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature becomes distracted by vengeful spirits and becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.  **Failure** As success, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is slowed 1 for 1 minute."
