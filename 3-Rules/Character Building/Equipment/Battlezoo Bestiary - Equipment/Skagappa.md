Sklaggans use these strange balls of writhing worms to intercept and interpret the dreams of sleeping subjects.

For 1 week, any creature that sleeps within 5 feet of the skagappa has increasingly fitful dreams. If it was Fatigued, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 Flat check when it sleeps. On a failure, the creature remains fatigued until it gets another full night's rest.

At any point during this week, a creature who takes possession of the skagappa can tap into its occult powers to learn 10 minutes' worth of information about the creature whose sleep has been affected. To do so, the creature must cast _Mindlink_ on the skagappa and succeed at a DC 15 Occultism check check. On a failed check, the spell is wasted, though the caster can attempt the check additional times by casting _mindlink_ again. Regardless, the same information is imparted each time the skagappa is tapped into. One week after it was placed near a creature's bedside, the skagappa unravels and its constituent worms slither away, destroying the item.
