* * *

This colorful orb of raw elemental energy is encased in a thin, lightly pulsating membrane. An ice zuggle orb deals 2d6 cold damage and 1 cold splash damage.

Spells can temporarily modify a held zuggle orb. If you Cast a Spell on the same round before you throw a zuggle orb, or you Ready an action to throw the zuggle orb upon being targeted with a spell, one of the following effects occurs.

*   **Different Trait** If the spell has an elemental or energy trait different than the zuggle orb's, the zuggle orb loses its elemental and energy traits and gains the same elemental and energy traits of the spell cast. Any damage the zuggle orb deals changes to the corresponding damage type. For example, if you cast _[[Spells/Shocking Grasp|Shocking Grasp]]_ on an adjacent creature immediately before you throw an ice zuggle orb, the zuggle orb loses the cold trait, gains the electricity trait, and deals electricity damage instead of cold. Disrupted and lost spells do not affect zuggle orbs in this way.
*   **Same Trait** If the spell has the same elemental or energy trait as the orb, then the orb becomes supercharged. When you throw a supercharged zuggle orb and roll a failure, you get a success instead; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead. A supercharged zuggle orb's splash radius increases by 5 feet.

In either case, the spell must be at least 1st level, and the effect on the zuggle orb lasts only until the end of your turn.

**Craft Requirements** Supply one zuggle orb.
