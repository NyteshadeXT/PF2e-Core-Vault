This long, thin dart is made from the spine of a salt stalker beast, and it still carries traces of that creature's deadly dehydrating poison. A creature hit by the salt stake is exposed to a weaker version of a salt stalker's venom. The salt stake is destroyed immediately after you Strike with it, regardless of whether your attack was a success.
