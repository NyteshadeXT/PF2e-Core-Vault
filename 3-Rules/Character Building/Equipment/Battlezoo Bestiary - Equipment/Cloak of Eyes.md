# Cloak of Eyes
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** worngarment

This gruesome garment is covered in eyeballs of every shape and size. It might be mistaken for a _Robe of Eyes_ if not for its crude construction and bloodstained fabric.

While wearing the _cloak of eyes_, you emit a dazzling aura to a range of 30-feet. A creature that starts its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude check save. On a failure, the creature is Dazzled for 1d4 rounds by the entrancing, unblinking eyes of the cloak. Regardless of the results of this save, the creature is immune to this aura for 24 hours. You can deactivate or activate this aura with a single action (this action has the concentrate trait).

While wearing a _cloak of eyes_, you take a -2 status penalty to saving throws against gaze attacks and cannot use the Avert Gaze action.
