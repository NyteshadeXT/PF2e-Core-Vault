The matted, shaggy fur hanging from this _+1 hide armor_ belies its expert make and the powers of its runic brands. While wearing _runebranded hide_, you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against electricity effects. _Runebranded hide_ with a _Resilient_, _Greater Resilient_, or _Major Resilient_ rune increases the item bonus to saving throws against electricity effects by +1, +2, or +3, respectively (to a maximum +4 item bonus).

**Activate** 1 The runebranded hide's runes glow intensely, then fade as the light transfers from the armor into your hands. Your melee Strikes deal additional electricity damage for 1 minute. The amount of electricity damage dealt is equal to 1d6 Ã— the armor's item bonus to saving throws against electricity effects. For 1 minute, the runebranded hide doesn't grant you its usual resistance to electricity or bonus to saving throws.
