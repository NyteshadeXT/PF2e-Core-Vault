description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Journeybread contains a mix of fruits, nuts, and grains with an alchemical boost. Eating one journeybread provides all the food and water you need for a day. If you subsist on nothing else for a week, you become temporarily immune to journeybread until you eat real food and drink water normally for 24 hours.  In addition to the benefits of journeybread, power journeybread grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]], and [[Actions/Swim|Swim]], and to Fortitude saving throws against being sickened. The number of minutes you can [[Actions/Hustle|Hustle]] changes to your Constitution modifier Ã— 20. These benefits last for 4 hours.
