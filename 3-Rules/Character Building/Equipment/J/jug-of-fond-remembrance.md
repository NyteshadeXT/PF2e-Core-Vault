description: "This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder's favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you're holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] or [[Actions/Request|Request]] something from that creature any time within the next month.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You take a long swig on the jug and then Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you fail but don't critically fail this check, you get a success instead. You're then [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 3 rounds."
