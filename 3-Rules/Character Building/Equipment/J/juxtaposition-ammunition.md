description: "**Ammunition** any  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  Juxtaposition ammunition quivers with anticipation, as if the projectile wishes to constantly be in motion. When an activated juxtaposition ammunition hits a creature, it doesn't deal the Strike's normal damage. Instead, the target must succeed at a DC 28 Will check save or be teleported to a safe, unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet of its original position and within the weapon's first range increment. On a critical failure, the target is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the gut-wrenching sensation of sudden movement. Any relocation from the juxtaposition ammunition is forced movement."
