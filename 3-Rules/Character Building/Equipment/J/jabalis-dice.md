description: "_Jabali's dice_ are two six-sided dice carved from evenly weighted stone to the specifications of a specific jabali shuyookh. The sides showing a 6 also have the name and title of the shuyookh inscribed in Petran. If you whisper the name and title during a dice game using _jabali's dice_, they bless you with a bit of luck, granting a +2 item bonus to your Games Lore check. You can do so frequently enough to apply this bonus while Earning Income using Games Lore, but only one user at a time can do so.  **Activateâ€”Jabali's Gamble** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You call out the shuyookh's name and title, then roll the dice. The shuyookh appears briefly to provide for your defense. Roll 2d6 to determine the effect. Represented by the GM, the shuyookh chooses any effect's specifications, benefiting you according to the shuyookh's whims.      | **2-5** | The shuyookh casts [[Spells/Mountain Resilience\|Mountain Resilience]] on you. | | --- | --- | | **6-9** | The shuyookh casts [[Spells/Grasping Earth\|Grasping Earth]] but you and your allies are immune to it. | | **10-11** | The shuyookh casts [[Spells/Wall of Stone\|Wall of Stone]]. The edges can pass through creatures, which are shunted to the side of the wall opposite that edge. | | **12** | The shuyookh casts a DC 31 [[Spells/Petrify\|Petrify]] spell on a creature hostile and in proximity to you. If no appealing target exists, you receive a 10-11 result instead. |"
