description: "These brightly colored, soft-soled boots motivate you to perform risky stunts and grant you the agility to succeed. The boots grant you a +3 item bonus to [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Tumble Through]] an enemy's space.  The boots can grip solid surfaces and help you avoid a fall, allowing you to use the [[Grab an Edge]] reaction even if your hands aren't free. You treat falls as 10 feet shorter or, if you have the [[Cat Fall]] feat, treat your proficiency rank in [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] as one degree better to determine the benefits of that feat. If you have [[Cat Fall]] and are already legendary in [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], you can choose the speed of your fall, from 60 feet per round up to normal falling speed."
