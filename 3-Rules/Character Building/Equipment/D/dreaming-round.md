description: "The night sky seems contained in this glass projectile. When an activated _dreaming round_ damages a creature, it induces drowsiness. The creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude check save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] and [[Fatigued]] for 1 round.\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] and [[Fatigued]], and must attempt another Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns. If it fails, its [[Slowed]] condition increases by 1. A successful save reduces the [[Slowed]] condition by 1. If the [[Slowed]] condition is removed or reduced to 0, the effect and the fatigued condition end. If the target's actions are reduced to 0 by this effect, it immediately falls into a deep sleep and is [[Unconscious]], during which it no longer attempts a save at the end of its turn. It wakes up automatically after 1 hour or if it takes damage, but not due to non-painful stimuli (such as noise or being nudged). When it wakes up, its [[Slowed]] condition decreases by 1, though it must once again save at the end of each of its turns and might risk falling asleep again.\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is initially [[Slowed|Slowed 2]]."
