description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  While some unscrupulous chefs claim that this savory pudding is made with real dragon's blood, its crimson color and acrid smell actually come from bloody mandrake paste, ginger root, and distilled terrap sap. This potent combination singes the nostrils and throat, removing effects that make you sluggish. When you consume the pudding, it attempts a counteract check with a +9 counteract modifier to remove the [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract rank and DC. You also become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round. While taking the additional action from being quickened, you scream, as a result of both the flavor and the mandrake paste's properties. You can use the additional action to Step, Stride, Strike, or [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]]. If you choose to Demoralize, you gain a +2 item bonus to the Intimidation check.
