Dawnflower beads also have the following activation.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** The beads cast 4th-rank light.  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** Cast 4th-rank versions of [[Spells/Bless|Bless]], [[Spells/Heal|Heal]], [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]], or [[Spells/Vital Luminance|Vital Luminance]] each once per day."
