description: "A _dreamstone_ is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to Desna-be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a _dreamstone_, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the _dreamstone_ for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a _dreamstone_, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (spellshape)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has the sleep trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended."
