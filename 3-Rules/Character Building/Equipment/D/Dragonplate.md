description: "This suit of +2 _greater resilient dragonhide full plate_ makes you look like a fearsome dragon. The armor comes in many different varieties depending on the type of dragon from which it's made, though they usually conform to the four magical traditions.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Dragon Breath** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You unleash a 15-foot cone of energy with a damage type and saving throw corresponding to the tradition of the dragon used to make the armor (shown on the table below). The cone deals 14d6 damage; each creature in the area must attempt a DC 36 basic saving throw.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,250 gp of dragonhide.      | Dragon Tradition | Damage | | --- | --- | | Arcane | Force (Reflex) | | Divine | Spirit (Reflex) | | Occult | Mental (Will) | | Primal | Poison (Fortitude) |"
