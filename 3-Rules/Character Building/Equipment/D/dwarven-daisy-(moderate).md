description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  * * *  A dwarven daisy is a string of dozens of firecrackers that create tiny, loud explosions. The string ends with a short, wrapped fuse. Pulling off the wrapping in a quick motion lights the fuse and is done as part of the action to Strike. A dwarven daisy deals the listed fire damage and splash damage. A dwarven daisy also has a chance to dazzle its target. A creature struck by a dwarven daisy must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude check save or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.  The firework deals 2d6 fire damage and 2 fire splash damage. The DC is 18."
