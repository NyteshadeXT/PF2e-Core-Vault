description: "This shining symbol of Sarenrae depicts the goddess with her arms held wide. In the center of the symbol is a crystal reliquary with a perfect feather floating inside, glowing bright as a candle with the light of the goddess.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day for each spell  * * *  **Effect** The _dawnlight_ casts 3rd-rank [[Spells/Vitality Lash|Vitality Lash]] or [[Spells/Light|Light]]. The _dawnlight_'s spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +13, and any spell with the light trait is treated as though its counteract rank were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.  Whenever you successfully counteract magical darkness while holding this symbol, the clash of magic unleashes a momentary flash of light. Creatures with darkvision in the area of the light spell or targeted by it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude check or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. Those with light blindness are also exposed to bright light.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine tradition."
