description: "This dragon-themed half-mask helps you to navigate through darkness and to notice things from afar—such as helping to find seats in a theater after a show begins, or to pick up details from a show even if you're seated in the back row! You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks and never take a penalty to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks based on distance or weather. You gain darkvision, or greater darkvision if you have darkvision. When you invest in the mask you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. If you are unholy, you become [[Blinded]] as long as you wear the mask."
