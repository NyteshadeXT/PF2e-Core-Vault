description: "The surface of this golden, heart-shaped locket is nearly worn through with cracks. If opened, it reveals a portrait of someone the bearer loved dearly and has lost. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 41.  *   **Armor** The _desolation locket_ numbs you to further despair, and you gain a +4 item bonus to saving throws against emotion effects. When you critically fail a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a failure instead. *   **Weapon**(emotion, mental) After you cast an enchantment spell by activating the _locket_, you emanate an aura of hopelessness in a 5-foot emanation until the start of your next turn. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must succeed at a Will saving throw against the locket's spell DC or become [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] ([[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Desolation Locket - Armor|Effect: Desolation Locket - Armor]]  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Desolation Locket - Weapon|Effect: Desolation Locket - Weapon]]  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Haunting Hymn|Haunting Hymn]].  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cast 7th-rank [[Spells/Wave of Despair|Wave of Despair]].  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Canticle of Everlasting Grief|Canticle of Everlasting Grief]]."
