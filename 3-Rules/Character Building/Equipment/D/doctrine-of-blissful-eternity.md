description: "The bones of small animals decorate the cover of this tome, creating a pattern that resembles a gross perversion of Pharasma's holy symbol.  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** An undead minion you summoned or created using a spell prepared from this grimoire takes damage that would bring it to 0 Hit Points  * * *  **Effect** You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of void energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell to restore 1d8 Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed."
