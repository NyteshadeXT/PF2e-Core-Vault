mechanics1: "You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of void energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a [[Harm]] spell to restore `dice: 1d8` Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed."
