description: "The metals used to forge this lead shot were taken from a variety of continents and barely stay together. When an activated dispersing bullet hits a target, the bullet scatters into a sphere of metal shards as the metals try to return to their places of origin. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the target of the attack (and not including the target) must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude check save or be pushed 10 feet from the target (15 feet on a critical failure)."
