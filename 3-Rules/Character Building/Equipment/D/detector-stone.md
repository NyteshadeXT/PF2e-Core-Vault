description: "During their journeys across the Gravelands, the Knights of Lastwall found several smoky, gemstone-like objects that knights refer to as _detector stones_. Some of the knights' Magaambyan allies believe the stones are _aeon stones_ corrupted by the same energies that corrupted the Gravelands, though they don't display the characteristic orbiting behavior of _aeon stones_ when invested. Despite the controversy, many knights use the stones for their ability to detect the presence of undead.  While you have a _detector stone_ invested, it glows faintly when an undead creature is within 30 feet of you, unless the undead is [[Hidden]] or disguised with a [[Skills#Deception|Deception]] or [[Skills#Stealth|Stealth]] result of 20 or higher. An invested stone may be carried in a pocket, but some knights set them in necklaces, bracelets, or weapon hilts."

Undead hiding or disguising themselves must make an additional [[Skills#Deception|Deception]] or [[Skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check to remain disguised or hidden from the activation, and the DC of the check is 23 rather than 20.

mechanics2: "You focus on the stone as it glows, and your eyes glow with the same tainted light. You detect the auras of evil undead in a 30-foot radius around you and learn each aura's location and strength. This has the effects of a 2nd-rank [[Detect Alignment]] spell but only detects evil undead."
