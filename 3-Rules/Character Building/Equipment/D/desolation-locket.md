description: "The surface of this golden, heart-shaped locket is nearly worn through with cracks. If opened, it reveals a portrait of someone the bearer loved dearly and has lost. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.\n\n**Armor** The _desolation locket_ numbs you to further despair, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.\n**Weapon**(emotion, mental) After you cast an enchantment spell by activating the _locket_, you emanate an aura of hopelessness in a 5-foot emanation until the start of your next turn. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must succeed at a Will saving throw against the locket's spell DC or become [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] ([[Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn."
