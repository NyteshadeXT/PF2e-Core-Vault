description: "Crafted by layering bamboo with strips of sliced scales harvested from a fire-breathing dragon, this bow has a significant draw strength. This design is commonly seen in Hongal, as the shorter limbs allow for easier maneuvering on horseback. While the wielder of this _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking]] [[composite shortbow]]_ is mounted, they apply the bow's item bonus to [[Skills#Nature|Nature]] checks to Command your mount."

You and your mount are immune to the effects of this _fireball_."
