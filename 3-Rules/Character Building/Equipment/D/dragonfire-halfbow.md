description: "Crafted by layering bamboo with strips of sliced scales harvested from a fire-breathing dragon, this bow has a significant draw strength. This design is commonly seen in Hongal, as the shorter limbs allow for easier maneuvering on horseback. While the wielder of this _+2 striking composite shortbow_ is mounted, they apply the bow's item bonus to Nature checks to Command your mount.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You draw the bow back to its maximum draw length without nocking an arrow, and as you release the string, the _dragonfire halfbow_ casts [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] (heightened to 5th-rank; DC 29 Reflex check save), targeted at a point of your choosing within the spell's range. You and your mount are immune to the effects of this _fireball_."
