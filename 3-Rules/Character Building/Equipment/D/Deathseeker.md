description: "A hauntingly beautiful and masterfully crafted blade, this _+1 striking wounding kris_ has been whet with the spilled blood of its creator, imbuing violent intent within its crimson curves. When you critically succeed at a Strike made with a deathseeker, the target feels the blade's unbridled bloodlust trying to consume it and must attempt a DC 24 Will check save; this effect has the incapacitation trait.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.  **Success** The target takes an additional 1 persistent bleed damage, and the DC for recovering from persistent bleed damage is 17, or 12 with particularly effective assistance.  **Failure** As success, except the target is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round. It gets a flat check to recover from this confusion when it critically succeeds at a Strike against another creature or reduces another living being to 0 Hit Points, but not when it takes damage.  **Critical Failure** As success, except the target is also confused for 3 rounds. It gets a flat check to recover from this confusion when it critically succeeds at a Strike against another creature or reduces another living being to 0 Hit Points, but not when it takes damage."
