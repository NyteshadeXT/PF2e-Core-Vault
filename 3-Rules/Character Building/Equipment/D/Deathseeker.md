description: "A hauntingly beautiful and masterfully crafted blade, this _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[striking]] [[wounding]] [[kris]]_ has been whet with the spilled blood of its creator, imbuing violent intent within its crimson curves. When you critically succeed at a Strike made with a deathseeker, the target feels the blade's unbridled bloodlust trying to consume it and must attempt a DC 24 Will check save; this effect has the incapacitation trait.<br><br>**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.<br>**Success** The target takes an additional 1 persistent bleed damage, and the DC for recovering from persistent bleed damage is 17, or 12 with particularly effective assistance.<br>**Failure** As success, except the target is also [[Confused|Confused]] for 1 round. It gets a flat check to recover from this confusion when it critically succeeds at a Strike against another creature or reduces another living being to 0 Hit Points, but not when it takes damage.<br>**Critical Failure** As success, except the target is also confused for 3 rounds. It gets a flat check to recover from this confusion when it critically succeeds at a Strike against another creature or reduces another living being to 0 Hit Points, but not when it takes damage."
