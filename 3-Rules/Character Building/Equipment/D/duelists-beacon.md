description: "A spiked glove is attached to the front of this _buckler_, functioning as _+1 striking shield spikes_. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee Strike with the duelist's beacon. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude check save or be [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.      | Hardness | HP | BT | | --- | --- | --- | | 6 | 24 | 12 |"
