description: "A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a +1 weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d10 poison damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Drake Shot** `pf2:3` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its normal damage.  On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following additional effects based on its damage type:  *   **Poison** Noxious vapors fill the target's lungs. The target becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the saliva glands of a ritually hunted drake with a breath weapon that deals the appropriate damage type for the drake rifle"
