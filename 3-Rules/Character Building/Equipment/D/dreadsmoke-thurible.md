description: "This black-and-gray thurible is decorated with a skeleton motif; the jaw of one of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing you to load it with incense as an action. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact; **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp  * * *  **Effect** You swing the thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20-foot emanation that has the effect of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]]. Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if it didn't exist. Void energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone who uses a void effect, along with creatures affected by a void effect, can see through the smoke for 1 round."
