mechanics1: "You swing the thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20-foot emanation that has the effect of [[Mist]]. Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if it didn't exist. Void energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone who uses a void effect, along with creatures affected by a void effect, can see through the smoke for 1 round.  Each usage requires incense worth at least 5 gp."
