description: "This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together, then wrapped tightly with strips of desiccated, gray skin. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a small stone orb resembling a large human eye. When the staff is activated, this eye twitches and glances around randomly. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks."
