description: "This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together, then wrapped tightly with strips of desiccated, gray skin. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a small stone orb resembling a large human eye. When the staff is activated, this eye twitches and glances around randomly. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks.  **Activate** [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]]  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Read Aura|Read Aura]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/Darkvision|Darkvision]], [[Spells/Floating Flame|Floating Flame]] (creates what appears to be a large eye made of fire), [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] *   **3rd** [[Spells/Organsight|Organsight]], [[Spells/Web of Eyes|Web of Eyes]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]], [[Spells/Countless Eyes|Countless Eyes]], [[Spells/Detect Scrying|Detect Scrying]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells."
