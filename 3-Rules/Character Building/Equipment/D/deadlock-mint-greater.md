description: "Bralani breath is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast [[Mystic Armor]] using bralani breath, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude check save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.  Objects of 1 Bulk or less and creatures that fail the save are pushed 10 feet. Objects of up to 2 Bulk are pushed 5 feet, and Huge creatures must succeed at the save or be pushed 5 feet."
