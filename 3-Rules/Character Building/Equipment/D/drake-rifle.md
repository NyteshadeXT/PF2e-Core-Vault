description: "A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a [[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1 weapon]]. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `dice: 1d10` damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to `dice: 1d4` + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects."

mechanics1: "You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its normal damage.  On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following additional effects based on its damage type:\n\n**Acid** Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to move. The target becomes [[Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n**Cold** Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.\n**Electricity** Small bursts of electricity continue to spark and jolt the target. The target becomes [[dazzled]] and [[off-guard]] for `dice: 1d4` rounds.\\n**Fire** A massive explosion knocks the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from you, and if it's on the ground, it falls [[prone]].\n**Poison** Noxious vapors fill the target's lungs. The target becomes [[enfeebled|enfeebled 1]] and [[Clumsy|clumsy 1]] for 1 minute."
