description: "Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a _druid's crown_ can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear _druid's vestments_ along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27. You can invest this item only if you're a druid. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The crown casts its spell at 2nd level (DC 20).  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You are a druid.      | Material | Item Bonus | Spell | | --- | --- | --- | | Antlers | Intimidation | [[Spells/Enlarge\|Enlarge]] | | Flowers | Diplomacy | [[Spells/Animal Allies\|Animal Allies]] | | Leaves | Stealth | [[Spells/One with Plants\|One with Plants]] |"
