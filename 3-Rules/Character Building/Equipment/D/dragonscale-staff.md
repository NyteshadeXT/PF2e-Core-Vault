description: "This _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[striking]] [[bo staff]]_ is covered in scales shed by or harvested from a dragon. When benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the bo staff's parry trait, you also gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison, according to the type of damage dealt by the breath weapon of the dragon that provided the scales; for instance, a staff made with scales taken from a white dragon would provide cold resistance. When this resistance prevents you from taking damage, the _dragonscale staff_ deals an additional 1 damage of the type matching its resistance for 1 round."
