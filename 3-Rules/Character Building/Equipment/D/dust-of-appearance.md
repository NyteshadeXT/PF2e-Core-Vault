description: "Stored in a small reed, this powder looks like a fine metallic dust. When you fling it in the air, it coats all creatures in a 10-foot burst centered on a point within 5 feet of you. For 1 minute, the coated creatures can't be concealed or invisible, nor can they benefit from [[Spells/Mirror Image|Mirror Image]] or similar abilities that create illusory duplicates. Any illusions in the area of 3rd level or lower are revealed as such, although this does not end their effect.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact"
