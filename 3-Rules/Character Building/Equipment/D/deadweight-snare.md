description: "This snare is made of magnetized weights and heavy ropes rigged to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a creature enters the square, the magnets and ropes deploy, weighing down the creature's weapons and limbs. The creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature takes a -1 status penalty to attack rolls for 1 round or until it [[Actions/escape dc=18|escape dc=18]]{Escapes} (DC 18).  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Deadweight Snare (Success)|Effect: Deadweight Snare (Success)]]  **Failure** The creature takes a -2 status penalty to attack rolls for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 18).  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature drops any metallic items it's holding.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Deadweight Snare (Failure_Critical Failure)|Effect: Deadweight Snare (Failure/Critical Failure)]]"
