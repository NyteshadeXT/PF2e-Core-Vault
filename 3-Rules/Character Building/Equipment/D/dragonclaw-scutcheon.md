trigger1: "You would take damage of a type depending on the talisman's dragon type (See Below)"
requirement1: "You have the affixed shield raised"
mechanics1: "When you Activate the scutcheon, you and all of your carried, wielded, or worn items gain immunity to all damage of that type until the end of your next turn.\n\nIf you have a _dragonclaw scutcheon_, [[dragonscale cameo]], and [[dragontooth trophy]] attached to your items, and they all correspond to the same type of dragon, you gain an extra benefit. When you Activate any of these talismans, you gain the ability to cast an 8th-rank [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/D/Dragon Breath|Dragon Breath]] focus spell (DC 35 Reflex check) as an innate spell once before the end of your next turn. Use the dragon type that matches the talismans; you can Cast the Spell this way without spending a Focus Point. Because each talisman disintegrates when used, you can't get this benefit again until you've attached a replacement.\n\n**Adamantine, Conspirator or Horned** Bludgeoning\n**Diabolic** Fire\n**Empyreal** Spirit\n**Fortune** Force\n**Mirage or Omen** Mental"
