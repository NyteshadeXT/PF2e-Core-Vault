description: "A _dragon rune bracelet_ is a gold bangle formed around the scale of a famous dragon. The bracelet is etched with esoteric symbols or words in Draconic that indicate kinship with dragons. As many types of _dragon rune bracelet_ exist as there are types of dragons, though bracelets associated with uncommon or rare dragons have the same rarity as the dragon. While wearing a _dragon rune bracelet_, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks while interacting with dragons of the same type as the bracelet's scale (such as red dragons or cloud dragons). You also gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects from any kind of dragon.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a sorcerer draconic bloodline spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You are a sorcerer of a draconic bloodline."
