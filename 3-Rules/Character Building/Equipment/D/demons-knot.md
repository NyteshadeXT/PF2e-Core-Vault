description: "The demon Kaivirris is housed in the magnificent ruby that serves as the centerpiece of this beautiful, goldplated, cold iron pendant necklace. Creatures within 30 feet of the _demon's knot_ feel a subtle urge to acquire the necklace and take a –1 status penalty to Will saves.<br><br>Upon donning the _demon's knot_, it fuses to you. You are subject to a [[Geas]] that requires you to free Kaivirris from his prison. If you die without completing this task, you become a sulfur zombie that always remains within 100 feet of the demon's knot and is under the control of whoever is cursed by the _demon's knot_.  The _demon's knot_ sustains your physical form and protects your mind from mental control. You don't need to eat or drink. You become immune to the [[Confused]] and [[Controlled]] conditions.  The _demon's knot_ corrupts anyone wearing it. You gain weakness to cold iron 10 and holy 10. Whenever you're within 60 feet of a celestial, you're [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] and can't reduce the value of the frightened condition below 2."
