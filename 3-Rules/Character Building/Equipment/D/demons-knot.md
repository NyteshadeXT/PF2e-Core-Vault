description: "The demon Kaivirris is housed in the magnificent ruby that serves as the centerpiece of this beautiful, goldplated, cold iron pendant necklace. Creatures within 30 feet of the _demon's knot_ feel a subtle urge to acquire the necklace and take a â€“1 status penalty to Will saves.  Upon donning the _demon's knot_, it fuses to you. You are subject to a [[Spells/Geas|Geas]] that requires you to free Kaivirris from his prison. If you die without completing this task, you become a sulfur zombie that always remains within 100 feet of the demon's knot and is under the control of whoever is cursed by the _demon's knot_.  The _demon's knot_ sustains your physical form and protects your mind from mental control. You don't need to eat or drink. You become immune to the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] and [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] conditions.  The _demon's knot_ corrupts anyone wearing it. You gain weakness to cold iron 10 and holy 10. Whenever you're within 60 feet of a celestial, you're [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and can't reduce the value of the frightened condition below 2.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You allow Kaivirris's corrupting influence over you to outwardly manifest. For 1 minute, your features adopt a cruel cast, and you radiate a palpable aura of evil. During this time, you gain a +2 status bonus to Intimidation checks, and your Strikes deal an additional 1d6 spirit damage.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Demon's Knot|Effect: Demon's Knot]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The demon's knot casts [[Spells/Chilling Darkness|Chilling Darkness]]."
