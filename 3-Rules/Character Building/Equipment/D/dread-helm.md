description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  The faceplate of a dread helm has a fierce visage that magnifies the effects of fear. Cleverly concealed within is a reservoir that can hold a single dread ampoule, which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded dread helm can be activated to atomize the dread ampoule, creating a fear-inducing mist that hangs around your face. The mist grants an item bonus to Intimidation checks equal to the dread ampoule's item bonus. The mist also deals mental damage equal to the dread ampoule's splash damage to all creatures within a 5-foot emanation other than you. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the dread ampoule, and once the atomization process has begun it can't be deactivated."
