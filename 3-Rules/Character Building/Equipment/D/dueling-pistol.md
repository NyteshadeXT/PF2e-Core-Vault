description: "Made for settling disputes when diplomacy fails, dueling pistols are finely crafted and made to fit easily into a holster or pocket. Noble and wealthy merchants in both Alkenstar and Dongun Hold often own matching pairs of dueling pistols in case they're called upon to address a challenge-though this practice has become increasingly rare in the modern age."
