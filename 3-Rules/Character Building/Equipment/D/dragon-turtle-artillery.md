description: "One end of this heavy cylinder of steel has been forged in the likeness of a dragon turtle's head, the mouth gaping wide. Grips at the opposite end allow one to hold and aim this heavy cannon-like barrel with both hands. As long as you're carrying dragon turtle artillery while you're on a boat or ship, the DC for any effect to capsize that vehicle increases by 4."
