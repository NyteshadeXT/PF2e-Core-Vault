description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  This foul-smelling oil has the appearance and odor of the greasy, thick fluids that seep from a decaying body. When you spread this oil on an intact corpse that has been dead no longer than 1 week, its decay fades and the corpse is restored to the condition it was just after death. _Demortification oil_ can't undo damage done to a corpse after death, such as consumption by scavengers. Applied to a non-incorporeal undead, a dose of _demortification oil_ grants the undead creature a +1 item bonus to Armor Class for 1 hour.
