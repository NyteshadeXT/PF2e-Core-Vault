If you are a devil, the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.\n\n**Critical Success** The target creature is unaffected.\n**Success** The target creature is [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round as its responses are muddled by your commands.\n**Failure** The creature is [[Controlled]] by you for 1 hour, although it doesn't follow commands that are obviously self-destructive.\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 day."
