description: "Rock fragments exposed to any dischoran's sonic blasts can sometimes retain a portion of the attack's energy, trembling slightly whenever they are touched. When you cast [[Noise Blast]] using a piece of _dischoran rubble_, the cacophony reverberates through the targets' forms for 1 round. If a creature that failed or critically failed its initial saving throw moves 10 feet or more on their next turn, it takes an additional `dice: 2d10` sonic damage."
