description: "These bones from different types of demons can be used to form temporary barriers. When you crush the bone fragments and blow the resulting dust around yourself as you cast [[Shield]], the shield appears as a bone bulwark shaped like the demon's face.  When use Shield Block with the spell, the barrier explodes into many bone fragments. The shards cause `dice: 1d6` bleed damage to each creature adjacent to you that fails a DC 20 Reflex check save. This persistent bleed damage is unholy and can be stopped with an Interact action to remove the shards."
