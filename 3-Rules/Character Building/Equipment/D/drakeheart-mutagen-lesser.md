description: "Your skin grows scales like a drake, and your eyesight become sharp and your pupils slitted, but your mind and reflexes slow.\n\n**Benefit** You gain +4 item bonus to AC, a Dexterity cap of +2 (as usual, use your lowest Dexterity cap if you have more than one), and a +1 item bonus to [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] checks. If you're wearing armor, you still calculate your proficiency bonus to AC based on your proficiency in the armor you're wearing, even if the drakeheart mutagen has a higher item bonus. You also gain the [[Final Surge]] action.\n\n**Drawback** You take a -1 penalty to Will saves, Reflex saves, and all skill checks to [[Recall Knowledge]].\n\n**Duration** 1 minute or until you use Final Surge, whichever comes first."
