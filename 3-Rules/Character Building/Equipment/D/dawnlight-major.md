mechanics1: "The _dawnlight_ casts 5th-rank [[Vitality Lash]] or [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/L/Light|Light]], or 4th-rank [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/H/Holy Light|Holy Light]] or [[Vital Beacon]]. The _dawnlight_'s spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +18, and any spell with the light trait is treated as though its counteract rank were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.  Whenever you successfully counteract magical darkness while holding this symbol, the clash of magic unleashes a momentary flash of light. Creatures with darkvision in the area of the light spell or targeted by it must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude check or be [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. Those with light blindness are also exposed to bright light."
