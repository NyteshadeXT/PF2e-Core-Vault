description: "These special straps and weightings fit over a shield or buckler, but not a tower shield. They are designed to let you doff and throw the shield in one swift movement. You can quickly remove the shield by spending a free action as part of the Strike to throw the shield. When thrown in this way, the shield is a martial thrown weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the thrown 20 feet trait. A shield with the throwing shield attachment can't have any attached weapons, such as shield spikes or a shield boss, and the adjustments to make it more aerodynamic make it slightly less sturdy, reducing its Hardness by 1."
