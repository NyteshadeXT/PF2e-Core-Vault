description: "Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power. Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.  **Activate** `pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per 10 minutes  * * *  **Effect** You hold out a hand and attempt to take something that doesn't belong to you. You telekinetically attracts an unattended, unsecured object of up to 5 Bulk within 100 feet. If the object is in a creature's possession, you must critically succeed at an attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] that creature, but you can't critically fail."
