description: "Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.  Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.  Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually."
