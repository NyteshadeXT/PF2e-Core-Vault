description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  For 10 minutes after drinking this astringent potion, you can't intentionally lie and may be compelled to tell the truth. Upon drinking the potion, attempt a DC 19 Will check save. You can voluntarily fail or critically fail.  **Success** The potion does not affect you.  **Failure** When you speak, you must tell the truth.  **Critical Failure** As failure, and when someone asks you a question, you must attempt another DC 19 Will check saving throw. If you fail this saving throw, you must answer the question truthfully if you are able to do so; if you succeed, you are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the same question within the potion's duration."
