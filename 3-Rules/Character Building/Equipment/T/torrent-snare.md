description: "You pile waterlogged plants or access a nearby source of water to rain down on a Medium or smaller creature that enters the snare's square. When a creature enters the square, the snare's square and all adjacent squares become slippery difficult terrain, and the triggering creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex check saving throw, with the following effects.  **Success** The target is unaffected.  **Failure** The target falls prone.  **Critical Failure** The target falls prone and is forced into one of the other squares soaked by the snare."
