description: "**Suit** Books (Int)  **Alignment** neutral evil  * * *  _The Fool_ represents grave foolishness, grand naivete, and exceptional greed. As long as you have _The Fool_ invested, anytime you gain the [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition, reduce its value by 1. You also gain a +2 item bonus to all saving throws against effects that cause the stupefied condition. This bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact (mental)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You display The Fool to your foes in a clumsy, awkward, and embarrassing way. Choose up to four creatures within 60 feet. These four creatures must attempt a Will check save against your class DC or spell DC.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is distracted by your antics and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the start of your next turn.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].  **Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]].
