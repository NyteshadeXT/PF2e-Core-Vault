description: "This ball of hempen twine resists efforts to unravel it by hand.  **Activateâ€”Unravel Twine** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** You toss the ball of twine into a square within 20 feet. The twine then unravels and animates, attempting to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] (your choice) a creature in the square with a total of +15 to the Athletics check. At the end of your turn, the twine winds itself back into a ball and returns to your hand; if you don't have a free hand, it returns to your space instead."
