description: "**Activate** Cast a Spell (add 1 action)  * * *  This carved chunk of amber contains a single tuft of gray feathers, which spark with electricity to create an odd jittery sensation in anyone holding the amber for long. When used as part of a [[Spells/Shocking Grasp|Shocking Grasp]] spell, _thunderbird tuft_ funnels electricity back into the spellcaster in a defensive nimbus. For 1 round, any creature that touches you or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack takes 1d4 electricity damage, or 1d6 electricity damage if the creature is using a metal weapon, but the nimbus only lasts 1 round, rather than the full minute."
