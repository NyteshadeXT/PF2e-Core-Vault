description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying ammunition damages a creature, it fills the creature's mind with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually, their own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]."
