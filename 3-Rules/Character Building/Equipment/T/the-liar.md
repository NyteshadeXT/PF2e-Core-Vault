description: "**Suit** Crown (Cha)  **Alignment** chaotic evil  * * *  _The Liar_ represents obsession or treacherous love. As long as you have _The Liar_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty to your Deception checks or an increase to your Deception DC, reduce that penalty or increase by half.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You touch a weapon and instill faithlessness within it. The weapon gains the backbiting curse. The curse lasts until you use this activation again. If you're at least 17th level, you can instead use this activation on a weapon within 30 feet. If the weapon is carried by a creature, it can resist the effect with a successful Will check save against your class DC or spell DC."
