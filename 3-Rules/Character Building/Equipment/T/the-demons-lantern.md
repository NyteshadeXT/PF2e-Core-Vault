description: "**Suit** Keys (Dex)  **Alignment** chaotic evil  * * *  _The Demon's Lantern_ represents trickery and feats of legerdemain. As long as you have _The Demon's Lantern_ invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks made to [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]], [[Actions/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]], or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** A creature hits you with a melee attack  * * *  **Effect** You release a flash of lights and attempt a Reflex saving throw. If your saving throw is higher than the attack roll for the triggering attack, it misses. If the attack misses, the attacker is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn."
