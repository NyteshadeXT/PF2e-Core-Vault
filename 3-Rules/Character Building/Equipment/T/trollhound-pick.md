description: "This _+1 striking greatpick_ bears a head studded with the tusks of a trollhound.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Ravenous Strike** `pf2:2` (magical, manipulate)  **Effect** You Strike with the _trollhound pick_, transferring a portion of a trollhound's legendary appetite to the target. A living enemy who takes damage from the attack must attempt a DC 19 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature suffers hunger pangs, becoming [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature experiences gnawing hunger, becoming off-guard for 1 round and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute. If the creature consumes any amount of food or drink (including imbibing a potion), the enfeebled condition ends.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and each instance of consuming food or drink reduces the penalty by 1.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the teeth and tongue from a trollhound."
