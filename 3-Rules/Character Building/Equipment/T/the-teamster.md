description: "**Suit** Shield (Con)  **Alignment** neutral  * * *  _The Teamster_ represents the driving force to push on, no matter the circumstance. As long as you have _The Teamster_ invested, all single-target effects that target you and require a saving throw gain the incapacitation trait. If the effect originates from a creature or effect of a level higher than yours, it doesn't gain the incapacitation trait in this way.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** you are affected by an ongoing condition  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You push through your largest hindrance. Select one of the following conditions currently affecting you: [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]], [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]], [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Damage]], [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]], [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]]. If the source of the condition is more than 4 levels lower than your current level, The Teamster automatically counters the condition. Otherwise, The Teamster attempts to counter the condition, with a counteract modifier of +31."
