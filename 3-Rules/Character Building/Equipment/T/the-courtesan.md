description: "**Suit** Crowns (Cha)  **Alignment** chaotic neutral  * * *  The Courtesan represents political intrigue and social niceties. As long as The Courtesan is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You pass the card over your face and become exactly who you need to be; you cast [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]]. The rank of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level). You can change your appearance again at any time during the duration by using a three-action activity, which has the concentrate trait. While under these effects, your Deception checks to Impersonate are one degree of success greater when you use them against a creature that is a lower level than yourself."
