description: "Copper cables run from these thick leather gloves to nodes that attach to the wearer's temples, allowing a spellcaster to convert the magic they normally cast to pure psychic intention. When you Cast a Spell using the telekinetic converters, you substitute any verbal spellcasting components for mental components of simple thought, granting the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature and you can cast cantrips  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Telekinetic Projectile|Telekinetic Projectile]] as an occult cantrip, heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature and have an unexpended spell slot of 5th level or higher  **Effect** You cast your choice of [[Spells/Telekinetic Haul|Telekinetic Haul]] or [[Spells/Telekinetic Maneuver|Telekinetic Maneuver]] as a 5th-rank occult spell, consuming one of your unexpended spell slots of the same rank as if you had used it to cast the spell."
