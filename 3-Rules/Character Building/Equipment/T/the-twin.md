description: "**Suit** Crowns (Cha)  **Alignment** neutral  * * *  _The Twin_ represents a duality of purpose or identity. As long as you have _The Twin_ invested, it helps to defend you against damage to your mind or your body. When you invest _The Twin_, the card's artwork changes to look like you, and as you are exposed to afflictions, your card twin helps to protect you by absorbing them into itself. You gain a +1 item bonus to saves against curses, diseases, poison, and transmutation effects. This bonus increases to +2 if you're at least 14th level, and to +3 if you're 20th level. As you resist these afflictions, they begin to manifest on one of the twins depicted on the card art.  **Activate** `pf2:3` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You twirl The Twin between your fingers and create a shadowy duplicate of yourself that mirrors your actions. The duplicate appears adjacent to you and has the same statistics as you do when you activate the card. You can sustain this effect for up to one minute. When you sustain the effect, your twin gains 2 actions. It always acts immediately after your turn, and must use identical actions to the ones you used, in exactly the same order. However, it can use the actions differently, such as Striding to a different position or selecting a different target for a Strike. If the twin is unable to mimic an action, it attempts the action without result and the action is wasted. The duplicate can't use any actions that can be used only a limited number of times per day (including casting any spell other than a cantrip). The duplicate isn't truly alive and can't be healed in any way. If the duplicate ever reaches 0 Hit Points, it is instantly destroyed and the effect immediately ends, and you take 10d6 mental damage (DC 38 Will check save)."
