description: "**Duration** 1 minute  Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude check. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.  The black dot at the center of this purple fulu draws in energy like a bottomless hole. The fulu deals 12d10 void by dissipating the target's ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes any other damage within 1 minute, it takes 2d10 persistent void as well. These effects have the death and void traits. Each time the target takes this persistent damage, any creature within 30 feet of it can use a reaction to gain temporary Hit Points equal to the persistent damage taken, distributing the available temporary Hit Points among those that take the reaction. If the creature that affixed the fulu is within 30 feet, it instead gains all the available temporary Hit Points, if it wishes. These temporary Hit Points disappear after 1 minute."
