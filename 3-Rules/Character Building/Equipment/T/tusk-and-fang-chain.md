description: "**Usage** affixed to armor  **Activate** `pf2:0` command  **Trigger** You Grab or restrain a creature or become grabbed or restrained by a creature  * * *  This length of silver chain has a tiger's fang on one end and the tip of a dire boar's tusk on the other. When you activate the chain, an ephemeral chain encircles the target creature's head and a cacophony of animal sounds clouds its mind. It must attempt a DC 35 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] on its next action.  **Failure** The creature is confused for 1 round.  **Critical Failure** The creature is confused for 1 minute and the creature doesn't receive a flat check to end its confusion if it takes damage. At the end of each of its turns, it attempts a new Will save, ending the effect on a success."
