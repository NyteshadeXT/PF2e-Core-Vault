description: "When the mighty fire-and-metal elemental _Temperbrand_ is defeated, their corpse transforms into a _+3 major striking greater flaming grievous shifting maul_ made of what appears to be molten steel, though it behaves as if it were made of solid metal. When a creature first picks up _Temperbrand_, they must succeed at a DC 43 Will check save to establish their dominance over the weapon. On a success, they become _Temperbrand's_ only accepted wielder and may use the weapon normally. On a failure, the character takes 20d6 fire damage (40d6 fire damage on a critical failure) and drops the weapon as it melts away into slag and immediately reforms in an adjacent space. A new attempt to establish dominance can be made by picking the weapon up again and attempting a new Will save. Once _Temperbrand_ has an accepted wielder, it can't be wielded by anyone else unless the accepted wielder intentionally permits it, declaring so in a loud voice; this permission can be rescinded in a similar manner. Anyone else trying to wield _Temperbrand_ after it has accepted a wielder takes fire damage and causes the weapon to melt away as if they failed the Will save to wield it.  The additional fire damage caused by _Temperbrand's_ greater flaming property (but not its persistent fire damage) is splash damage. _Temperbrand's_ wielder is immune to this splash damage.  **Activateâ€”Molten Smash** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You smash _Temperbrand_ against the ground or another solid adjacent surface, causing an explosion of molten metal and force to radiate outward in a 20-foot emanation. All creatures in this area take 10d6 fire damage and 6d6 force damage (DC 43 Reflex check save); those who critically fail this save are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. You are immune to the effects of Molten Smash, but your allies are not."
