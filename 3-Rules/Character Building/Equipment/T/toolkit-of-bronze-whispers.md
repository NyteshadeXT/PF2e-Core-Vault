A toolkit of bronze whispers functions as a set of [[Equipment/Artisan's Toolkit (Sterling)|Artisan's Tools (Sterling)]]. Such toolkits focus on new creations and enthusiastically suggest crafting techniques to wielders. A toolkit of bronze whispers knows common item formulas of its level or lower and any other formulas the GM chooses. It can teach these formulas. You must still spend the time to copy a formula before you can use it."
