description: "**Duration** 1 minute  Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a DC 27 Fortitude check. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.  Picking up this white fulu feels like you've stabbed your hand with a pin. The fulu deals 7d6 piercing as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the move trait, it takes 2d6 persistent piercing."
