description: "**Suit** Stars (Wis)  **Alignment** neutral  * * *  _The Owl_ represents the wisdom of nature and the natural order. As long as you have _The Owl_ invested, it grants a +2 item bonus to Perception checks made to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]], Survival checks to [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] in the wild, and Nature checks made when you activate this card. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.  **Activate** 1 hour (command, envision, Interact)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** After spending an hour meditating, you can ask one question of the region's spirits, as if you had just performed a [[Spells/Commune|Commune]] ritual. Attempt a DC 30 Nature check check to determine the result."
