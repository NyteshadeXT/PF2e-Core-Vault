description: "The carved talon of an unidentifiable beast comprises this wand. Blood-stained cloth wraps the thicker part of the talon, which acts as a handle.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge  * * *  **Effect** You cast 4th-rank [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]], but the slumbering creatures have terrifying nightmares. A creature knocked [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] by this spell takes 1d6 persistent mental. This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the persistent mental damage or not), it's [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its frightened condition automatically on that turn.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of 4th-rank [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]]."
