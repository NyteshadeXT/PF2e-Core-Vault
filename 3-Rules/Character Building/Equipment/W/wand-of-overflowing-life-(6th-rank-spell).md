After you cast the spell, at the start of your next turn, excess healing magic wells up from the wand and heals you, as though you cast the 1-action version of _heal_ on yourself at 6th-rank. You gain this benefit only once per turn, even if you cast multiple _heal_ spells from _wands of overflowing life_ in the same turn.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _heal_ at 6th-rank."
