description: "This set of hinged metal plates features studs on the inside of each plate to provide a texture for the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.  The plates of this waffle iron are made of standard-grade dawnsilver rather than iron and might bear an imprint on the plates. As with other dawnsilver cookware, food rarely sticks to a dawnsilver waffle iron. As it's made of dawnsilver, this is an uncommon item."
