description: "This chime's carvings depict skulls and other grim icons. When activated, it creates an aura of [[Spells/Fear|Fear]] in a 5-foot emanation for 1 round. Creatures in the aura must attempt a DC 27 Will check save. On a failure, they become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). Affected creatures can't reduce their frightened condition below frightened 1 while the chime is ringing. You can Sustain the Activation to sustain the aura, up to a total of 5 rounds. This chime can be used only once per day, whether or not you Sustain the aura."
