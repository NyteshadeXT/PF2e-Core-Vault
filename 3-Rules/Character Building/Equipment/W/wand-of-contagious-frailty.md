The bone's worn epiphysis forms the wand's pommel, and black leather wraps around the handle.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Enfeeble|Enfeeble]]. After you cast the spell, if the target is enfeebled, it releases a 10-foot emanation that doesn't include itself. Each creature in that area must attempt a Fortitude save as if struck by the [[Spells/Enfeeble|Enfeeble]] but gets an outcome one degree of success better than it rolled.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Enfeeble|Enfeeble]]."
