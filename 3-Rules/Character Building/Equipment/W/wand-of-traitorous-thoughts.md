description: "When you hold this sleek, shiny gray wand, you hear a faint chorus of overlapping whispers.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]]. The first time the target rolls a success at a Deception check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled. This means you learn the answer if the target's Deception check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]]."
