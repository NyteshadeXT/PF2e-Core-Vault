description: "Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge  * * *  **Effect** You cast 2nd-rank [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]], and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes 1d4 piercing damage from the thorns. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] of the appropriate rank."
