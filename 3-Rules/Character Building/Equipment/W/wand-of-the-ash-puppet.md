description: "This wand is composed of ash that has been compressed, shaped, and sealed with a clear lacquer. When you trace the wand's tip along a solid surface, it leaves a black trail of charcoal. Writing with the wand in this way never damages or wears the wand down.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]. If the spell reduces a living creature to fine powder, you animate that creature's ashes into a [[Bestiary 3/Sulfur Zombie|Sulfur Zombie]] with the same general appearance as the disintegrated creature. You control this sulfur zombie, which gains the minion and summoned traits. You can issue a verbal command to the sulfur zombie as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. The sulfur zombie crumbles into inanimate ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]."
