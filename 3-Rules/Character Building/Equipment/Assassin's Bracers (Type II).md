**Effect** You designate one creature within 30 feet. You cast 4th-rank [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] on yourself, but the designated creature can still see you. The bracers enhance your appearance to the designated creature, making you appear more fearsome and unnerving, granting you a +1 item bonus to attempts to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] or [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the designated creature. The designated creature takes a –2 item penalty to saving throws against fear effects.
