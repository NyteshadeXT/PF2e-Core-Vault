description: "This _+1 [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]] striking whip_ has a single strip of anointed leather wrapped around its hilt in a spiral pattern. The handle of the whip ends in an oak spike that has been sanctified with ashes from Pharasma's Boneyard. If the spike is used to stake a vampire that's vulnerable to being staked, the vampire is immediately destroyed, without having to sever its head and anoint it with holy water. If the whip is buried with a creature, that creature can't rise as an undead as long as the whip remains by its side."
