description: "Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this _+1 resilient chain mail_ includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks and Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]], but take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy and Society checks.  This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Leopard's Armor|Effect: Leopard's Armor]]"
