description: "This enchanted lasso is a [[Equipment/Net|Net]] that can be used to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 Athletics check check to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]], and has an [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope. While using the lawbringer's lasso to Grapple, you receive a +1 item bonus to Grapple checks against creatures with the chaotic trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to Grapple a chaotic creature with the lawbringer's lasso, you get a failure instead."
