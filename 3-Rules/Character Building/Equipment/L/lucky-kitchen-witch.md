description: "This small doll in the shape of a witch is made from sticks and clad in a simple dress, bonnet, and wooden shoes. It sits astride a miniature straw broom. When hung in a kitchen, the witch brings good luck and protects a cook from malicious spirits. The _lucky kitchen witch_ must hang in a kitchen for a week to give any benefit.  When you have a _lucky kitchen witch_ hung in your kitchen, you can reroll a Cooking Lore or Crafting check made during downtime to make food, [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], or Craft an alchemical item in your kitchen."
