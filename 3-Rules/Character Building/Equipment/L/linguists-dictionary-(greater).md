description: "Bound in sturdy leather, this thick book has several colorful bookmarks and page dividers. Its title and text shift between numerous languages.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as [[Spells/Translate|Translate]] or [[Spells/Truespeech|Truespeech]]  * * *  **Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The _greater linguist's dictionary_ can hold three languages at a time."
