description: "Luck and good fortune bless the wielder of this _+3 greater striking shortsword_. _Luck blades_ are crafted in a variety of styles, but their hilts or blades always incorporate symbols of luck, such as clovers, horseshoes, fish, ladybugs, or other symbols.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You miss on a Strike with the _luck blade_  **Effect** Reroll the triggering attack roll and use the new result. This is a fortune effect.  * * *  Some _luck blades_ contain one [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] when crafted. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell while wielding the _luck blade_, expending the spell. A spellcaster who can cast _wish_ can place another _wish_ into the blade by spending 8,000 gp and 4 days of downtime. A _wishing luck blade_ can hold no more than one _wish_ at a time.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _wish_."
