[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Embolden|Effect: Embolden]]  * * *  **Activate—Arazni's Fervor** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** You worship Arazni or are favored by her  **Effect** You hold the Liver Bloodstone aloft, and the Bloodstone glows with crimson light, filling you and your allies with Arazni's wrath. The Liver Bloodstone casts [[Spells/Bless|Bless]]. For the next minute, you can use a free action at the beginning of each of your turns to increase the spell's emanation radius by 10 feet. You can't increase the emanation's radius in any other way.  * * *  **Destruction** The Liver Bloodstone melts into a puddle of poison if a worshipper of Arazni willingly submerges the Bloodstone in a lethal contact or consumed poison, then licks the Bloodstone clean. Each creature in a 15-foot emanation is exposed to the poison that destroyed the _Bloodstone_, as if they'd touched or consumed that poison."
