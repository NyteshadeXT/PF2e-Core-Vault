Despite the name, which stems from the dagger's historical basis in Oppara as a lady's favor, this dagger is common among wielders of all genders and has become quite fashionable in Absalom of late, with most nobles who carry them matching their evening finery to the gems on the hilt.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You offer this weapon as a romantic or platonic favor to an ally.
