description: "Various parts of this +2 _resilient half plate_ are forged into the shape of a lion's head. The golden lion heads grant you a commanding presence and seem to actively growl at your enemies, granting you a +2 item bonus to Intimidation.  The lions on the armor work in tandem with the lion on a _lion's shield_. If you critically hit with the _lion's shield_ using Lion Bite, the lions on the armor roar in support of the shield, causing the target of the shield's Strike to become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].  **Activateâ€”Roar of the Pride** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The lions on your armor roar, attempting to cow your enemies. Attempt a check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet of you. On a critical success, the target is also [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round."
