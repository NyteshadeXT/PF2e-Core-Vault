description: "The covers of this book are bound in scratchy, purple leatherâ€”hide harvested from a mind-manipulating wormlike monster known as a seugathi. The margins of this grimoire contain hundreds of tips and notes to avoid having your lies discovered. When you prepare spells from a _liar's lexicon_, you gain a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]].  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision (spellshape)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** If your next action is to cast a spell that has the emotion trait, your skill at manipulation and exploiting emotion enhance the spell. The spell gains the linguistic trait. Attempt a Deception check to Lie as you cast the spell against the Perception DC of all those observing you. Those you succeed against think you were merely talking, not casting a spell on a creature."
