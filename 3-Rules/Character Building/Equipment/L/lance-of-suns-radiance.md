description: "Crafted for a long-forgotten knight to slay Avathrael Realmshaper, this _+2 striking dragon bane lance_ is crafted from gleaming steel with a golden silk banner depicting a radiant sun. When in a location of dim light or darkness, the _lance of sun's radiance_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for a further 60 feet.  * * *  **Activate—Banish Darkness** `pf2:1` (divine, light, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You tap the lance's tip against an object, causing that object to shed light like a torch for 1 hour.  * * *  **Activate—Sun Cutting Scales** `pf2:2` (divine, light, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** With a bold proclamation, you thrust the lance forward, firing a beam of brilliant, scouring light in a 120-foot line. Creatures in the area take 6d8 spirit damage, or 6d12 spirit damage if they're a dragon (DC 28 Reflex check save). Creatures that critically fail are also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round."
