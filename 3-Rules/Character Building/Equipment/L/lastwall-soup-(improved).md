description: "**Activate** 1 minute (Interact)  * * *  Crimson Reclaimers make this rich, hearty soup using herbs that baffle the senses of the undead. A bowl of Lastwall soup is as nourishing as a full meal. Gravelands Herbalists have spent time with the Knights of Lastwall, and have learned how to improve upon Lastwall soup.  For 1 hour after consuming a bowl of improved Lastwall soup, you gain a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks and DCs against undead.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Lastwall Soup|Effect: Lastwall Soup]]  * * *  _Note: Paizo did not provide a price for this item, so we set it as appropriate for a level 10 consumable._"
