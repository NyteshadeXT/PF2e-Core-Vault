description: "The _Lung Bloodstone of Arazni_ represents suffering. While you carry the Lung Bloodstone, you gain the ability to turn your pain into a weapon against your enemies.  **Activate—Strength Through Pain** `pf2:r` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You take damage  **Effect** You allow the pain to resonate within you, making you stronger. You gain a +1 status bonus to your next Strike or spell attack before the end of your next turn.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Strength Through Pain|Effect: Strength Through Pain]]  * * *  **Activate—Admonish** `pf2:2` (auditory, emotion, incapacitation, mental)  **Requirements** You worship Arazni or are favored by her  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You point your finger at a creature within 60 feet that has wronged you, and you verbally admonish them. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage for every level you have (Will check save against your class DC). On a failed save, the creature is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure).  * * *  **Destruction** To destroy the _Lung Bloodstone_, a worshipper of Arazni must willingly impale themself with the Bloodstone's horned figurehead, dealing themselves 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 persistent bleed damage. The _Lung Bloodstone_ then evaporates into a cloud of noxious vapors, as [[Spells/Toxic Cloud|Toxic Cloud]] (DC 28), that follows the creature that destroyed the _Bloodstone_ for its duration."
