description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  This crystal vial contains salts blessed by channeling life-giving energies into waters purified by holy fire. You can activate this vial by throwing it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. On a hit against an undead, _life salt_ deals 1 persistent vitality damage, and the undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will check or be unable to attack you as long as it continues taking the persistent vitality damage. If you use a hostile action against any undead, this second effect ends, and the undead can attack you normally."
