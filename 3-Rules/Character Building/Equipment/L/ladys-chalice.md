description: "This silver chalice bears the symbol of Pharasma, a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** Once per day  * * *  **Effect** The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of _[[Equipment/Holy Water|Holy Water]]_. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of Pharasma. It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The _Lady's Chalice_ is full of a vial's worth of _holy water_  * * *  **Effect** The chalice splashes a spiral of _holy water_ into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals 2d6 spirit damage and 2 spirit splash damage (including to you, if you're evil)."
