description: "**Ammunition** any  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  Ooze ammunition is a capsule containing a sticky substance. If you hit a creature with activated ooze ammunition, it deals acid damage instead of its normal damage type, and the creature then takes a -5-foot penalty to Speed and 1d4 persistent acid damage until it ends the effects. On a critical hit, the creature is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round in addition to the other effects. The target can end the effects by [[Actions/Escape|Escaping]] (DC 16) the sticky foam. Other creatures can provide the actions, although doing so deals half the ammunition's persistent acid damage to the assisting creature. A creature that ends the effect still takes the persistent damage that turn.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Ooze Ammunition|Effect: Ooze Ammunition]]"
