description: "This elaborate choker is fashioned from the treated hide of a water orm. Its interior is lined with the creature's silky hair. While wearing an _orm choker_, your form blurs slightly around the edges, granting you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against detection, revelation, and scrying effects.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Watery Form** `pf2:3` (concentration, water)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You dissolve into liquid, appearing only as a stretch of flowing water. While in this form, you gain a swim Speed of 45 feet, you automatically succeed at Athletics checks to Swim, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks in water. However, you can't speak, use any of your other items or abilities, or enter a body of salt water while in this form. You can remain in this form for up to 1 hour, though you can return to your normal form using a single action that has the concentrate trait.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Watery Form|Effect: Watery Form]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the hide and hair of a water orm."
