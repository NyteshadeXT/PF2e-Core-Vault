description: "You can easily expand and contract the chain of this _+3 major striking greater extending war flail_. It magically grows new links when extended and loses them when contracted.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You successfully Strike with the flail while activating its extending rune  * * *  **Effect** The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering Strike and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude check save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target Escapes (DC 43), or you use the flail.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:3` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 120-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold."
