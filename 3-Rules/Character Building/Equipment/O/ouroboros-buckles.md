description: "This ominous-looking _+3 greater resilient greater acid-resistant buckle armor_ is deep red in color, favored by assassins who worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, and if unfastened, the many belts and buckles writhe like living snakes. _Ouroboros buckles_ have the comfort trait. However, while wearing _ouroboros buckles_, the unfathomable concept of infinity pulls at your mind, and each time you awaken, you'd swear the armor hissed into your ear while you were asleep. The hissing suggested secret wisdom to you in Aklo, though you only ever remember it vaguely, like a fading dream.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You call forth the cursed regenerative blood of an ouroboros to recover from your wounds. You gain regeneration 15 for 1 minute; fire damage deactivates this regeneration. Each time you regain Hit Points from this regeneration, if you're in your normal form, you collapse into a Large swarm of Tiny snakes. This is a polymorph effect that changes you into a battle form.  When you're a swarm of snakes, you gain low-light vision, imprecise scent (30 feet), a Speed of 20 feet, a climb Speed of 20 feet, and a swim Speed of 20 feet. You have an AC of 16 + your level and ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. Also, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage and weakness 5 to area damage and splash damage. You can use none of your normal Strikes. Instead, you can use Swarming Bites, a single action that deals 4d4 piercing plus 2d6 poison to creatures in your space with a DC 41 Reflex check.  If you're in this battle form and are already at full HP when your regeneration occurs, the snakes instantaneously slither together, and you transform into your original form.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per minute  **Trigger** A foe within 15 feet hits you with a Strike that deals slashing or piercing damage  **Effect** Your _ouroboros buckles_ spray acidic blood in a 15-foot cone toward the foe, dealing 5d6 acid with a DC 41 Reflex check.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include blood from an ouroboros to tan the leather."
