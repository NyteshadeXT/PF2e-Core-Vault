description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  Eight flailing octopus arms covered in suckers pop out from the sides of your body when you imbibe this potion. The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll 1d4 to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently grappled or restrained (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.  The Athletics modifier is +12 and the Escape DC is 20.      | bludgeoning damage equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns. | | --- |"
