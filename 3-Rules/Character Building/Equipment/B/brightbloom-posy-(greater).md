Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a hit ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Tangle Vine|Tangle Vine]].  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Soothing Blossoms|Soothing Blossoms]].  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Petal Storm|Petal Storm]]."
