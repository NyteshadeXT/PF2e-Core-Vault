description: "This _+2 greater striking shifting shortsword_ is formed of rapidly vibrating air and magical energy, though it uses the same statistics as iron. The wooden hilt is adorned with four gems, representing the energies of acid, cold, fire, and electricity, that sparkle in sequence at random intervals.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` Interact  **Frequency** once per round  **Effect** You draw magical energy from one of the gems. Roll 1d4. Until the start of your next turn, the weapon gains the corresponding rune:  1.  _[[Equipment/Corrosive|Corrosive]]_, 2.  _[[Equipment/Flaming|Flaming]]_, 3.  _[[Equipment/Frost|Frost]]_, or 4.  _[[Equipment/Shock|Shock]]_.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Blade of Four Energies|Effect: Blade of Four Energies]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The blade has an energy rune from the first activation  **Effect** You call upon the energy stored in the blade to explode outward. The blade of four energies casts a 5th-rank spell that depends on the active rune:  1.  [[Spells/Acid Arrow|Acid Arrow]] for _corrosive_, 2.  [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] for _flaming_, 3.  [[Spells/Cone of Cold|Cone of Cold]] for _frost_, or 4.  [[Spells/Lightning Bolt|Lightning Bolt]] for _shock_.  The DC for these spells is 30 and the spell attack modifier is +20."
