trigger1: "Your Strike with the affixed weapon damages a creature."
requirement1: "You're an expert in Athletics."
mechanics1: "When you activate this talisman's effect, attempt to [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/G/grapple|Grapple]] the creature you hit. On a success, rather than the normal Grapple effects, the coil instead wraps itself around the target with one end remaining attached to your weapon. Your opponent must succeed at a DC 30 [[Escape]] check to break free. The coil breaks if you move any further away from the bound opponent, but not if you move any closer."
