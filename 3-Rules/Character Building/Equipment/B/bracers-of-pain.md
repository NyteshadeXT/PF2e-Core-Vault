mechanics1: "Your bracers snap tight onto your wrists, driving the studs into your skin to shock you into focus. You can attempt to [[counteract]] the effect causing your condition, with a counteract rank of 6th and a counteract modifier of +22. On a success, you lose the condition. If you have more than one condition from the same source, you only need one counteract check against them."
