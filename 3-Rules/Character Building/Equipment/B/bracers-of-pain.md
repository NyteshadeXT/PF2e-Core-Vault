description: "These simple bracers look plain on the exterior, but a series of small, sharp studs line the interior like rows of shark teeth. While these bracers are worn and invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to Will saves.  **Activateâ€”Sharp Focus** `pf2:0` (concentrate)  **Trigger** You gain an effect that makes you [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], or [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]  * * *  **Effect** Your bracers snap tight onto your wrists, driving the studs into your skin to shock you into focus. You can attempt to counteract the effect causing your condition, with a counteract rank of 6th and a counteract modifier of +22. On a success, you lose the condition. If you have more than one condition from the same source, you only need one counteract check against them."
