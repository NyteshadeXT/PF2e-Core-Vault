description: "This _+1 striking wounding shortsword_ has the design of a fanged mouth carved into the handle. Whenever the blade draws blood, it glows with a dull red energy, as if empowered by the taste of blood.  * * *  **Activate—Drink Life** `pf2:2` (concentration)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** The blood-drinker blade guides your hand to cut a foe and feeds you from their blood. Make a Strike with the blade. On a hit, the attack deals an additional 1d8 persistent bleed damage. You also gain 1d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 minute.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Blood-Drinker Blade|Effect: Blood-Drinker Blade]]  * * *  **Activate—Exsanguinate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** Your most recent action was to successfully deal persistent bleed damage to a creature with Drink Life  **Effect** The blade's power draws even more blood from your victim.
