description: "This rune causes a weapon to transform into pure, brilliant energy. The weapon deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on a successful Strike, as well as 1d4 spirit damage to fiends and 1d4 vitality damage to undead.  On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude check or be [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Shine Bright!** `pf2:1` (concentrate, light)  * * *  **Effect** You plunge your weapon into darkness to return the light. Attempt a counteract check with a counteract rank of 9 and a +31 counteract modifier to end a magical darkness effect whose area is within reach of the weapon.  Damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's resistances to fire, spirit, and vitality."
