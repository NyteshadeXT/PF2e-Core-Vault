description: "Though it resembles an enormous leaf freshly plucked from a tree, a _broadleaf shield_ is extremely durable. It also regrows rapidly, fully repairing itself when broken if it's left in sunlight for 10 consecutive minutes.<br><br>At each dawn, the leaf transforms to an appearance appropriate for the season. While you're wielding the shield, you gain resistance 4 to a damage type depending on the shield's color. This resistance doubles while you have the shield raised.<br><br>**Pink** (void resistance) In spring, the leaf is a delicate blossom-like pink and exudes the energy of life.<br>**Green** (fire resistance) In summer, the leaf is a deep, rich green with a waxy coating.<br>**Orange** (poison resistance) In autumn, the leaf turns orange, red, or yellow and dehydrates slightly.<br>**Brown** (cold resistance) In winter, the leaf turns dead, dry, and brown."
