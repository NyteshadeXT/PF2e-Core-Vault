description: "A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either a [[dagger]], [[dart]], [[shuriken]], or [[starknife]]. Configuring a blade launcher requires three [[Interact]] actions. Once properly configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a blade launcher requires a single [[Interact]] action. A blade launcher can't fire weapons for which it's not currently configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the [[agile]], [[monk]], [[thrown]], and [[versatile]] traits, if it has them, and has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the [[thrown]] weapon trait, returning and most other effects that allow a weapon to return don't function; even if a launched weapon did return, you'd still need to load it into the blade launcher with an [[Interact]] action to fire the blade launcher again."
