mechanics1: "When activated, a big rock bullet transforms into a giant rock just before hitting the target. The target takes `dice: 8d6` 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Even on a failed attack roll (but not a critical failure), the target takes `dice: 4d6` 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures with the [[Catch Rock]] reaction can use it against a big rock bullet."
