description: "**Ammunition** arrow, bolt  **Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  The shaft of a _beacon shot_ is studded with tiny flecks of glimmering gemstones. When an activated _beacon shot_ hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it becomes merely [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition if the target was otherwise concealed.  A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 Athletics check check."
