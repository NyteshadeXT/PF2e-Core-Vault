mechanics1: "When you activate the stone, you throw it into a space within 100 feet. The stone then casts [[Translocate]] on you and transports you to itself. This destroys the stone.  You can instead hurl the stone at a creature in an attempt to bring that creature closer to you. Make a ranged [[Strike]] against a creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. The _swapping stone_ has a range increment of 15 feet. On a hit, the stone shatters against the creature, casting _[[Translocate]]_ on the creature and causing it to instantly teleport to a space adjacent to you. An unwilling creature can resist this teleportation with a successful DC 31 Will check save."
