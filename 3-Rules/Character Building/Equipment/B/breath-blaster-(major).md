description: "A _major breath blaster_ is a _+3 major striking blunderbuss_ most commonly crafted from the trachea of a dragon, though other creatures with breath attacks or the ability to spit energy are occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon's trachea allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.  A _breath blaster's_ Strikes deal either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon type or other creature from which it was made, though it can otherwise be used like a normal blunderbuss. A breath blaster also can be activated to fire a line of energy in a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone, chosen when it's created and typically corresponding to the shape of the breath attack used by the type of dragon or creature from which the _breath blaster was created._  In theory, the foundational techniques required to create a breath blaster would allow for other damage types, but such breath blasters would require the trachea from the correct dragon or creature type and additional creation techniques, making such a breath blaster rare rather than uncommon.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Breath Blast** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per minute  **Effect** You fire the breath blaster, dealing 10d6 untyped damage of the appropriate type in the appropriate area. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 38 Reflex check save (or DC 38 Fortitude check save if the damage is poison).  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the trachea of a ritually hunted dragon or other creature with a breath attack with the appropriate damage type and area (line or cone) for the _breath blaster_."
