description: "This _+3 greater striking shifting shortsword_ is formed of rapidly vibrating air and magical energy, though it uses the same statistics as iron. The wooden hilt is adorned with four gems, representing the energies of acid, cold, fire, and electricity, that sparkle in sequence at random intervals.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` Interact  **Frequency** once per round  **Effect** You draw magical energy from one of the gems. Roll 1d4. Until the start of your next turn, the weapon gains the corresponding rune:  1.  _[[Equipment/Corrosive (Greater)|Greater Corrosive]]_, 2.  _[[Equipment/Flaming (Greater)|Greater Flaming]]_, 3.  _[[Equipment/Frost (Greater)|Greater Frost]]_, or 4.  _[[Equipment/Shock (Greater)|Greater Shock]]_.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Blade of Four Energies|Effect: Blade of Four Energies]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The blade has an energy rune from the first activation  **Effect** You call upon the energy stored in the blade to explode outward.
