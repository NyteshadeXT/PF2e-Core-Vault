description: "Etchings of powerful bears decorate these brass bracers. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to lift a heavy object, [[Escape]], and [[Force Open]]. When you invest the bracers, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.  "
