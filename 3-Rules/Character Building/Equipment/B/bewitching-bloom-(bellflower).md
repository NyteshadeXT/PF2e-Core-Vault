description: "While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of bellflowers.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. A need for freedom trills through your ally's blood. Until the end of that ally's next turn, they gain a +2 status bonus to rolls to recover from the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], frightened, [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], and [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] conditions. When you Activate the bloom, the target can attempt a new save against a condition the bonus applies to, or they can use a reaction to attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] being grabbed, [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or restrained, provided such an attempt is allowed."
