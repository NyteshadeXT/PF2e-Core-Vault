description: "The blade of this _+2 striking dagger_ is etched with whirling portals, and a single blue sapphire adorns its hilt. It feels lightweight and is always slightly warm to the touch.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]]. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or until the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. When used in strong winds, the smoke disperses immediately.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** Your melee attack roll with the _blink blade_ is a critical success  **Effect** You and your target teleport to a space within 10 feet. The target arrives in a safe, open space of your choosing adjacent to your arrival space. This teleportation also creates puffs of smoke, as noted with the activation above."
