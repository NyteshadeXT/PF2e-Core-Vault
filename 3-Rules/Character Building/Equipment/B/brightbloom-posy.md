The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.  *   **Armor** You gain the ability to speak with flowers, as [[Spells/Speak with Plants|Speak with Plants]]. *   **Weapon** (disease) After you cast a plant spell by activating the posy, pollen coats your weapon. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a hit ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.  **Activate** Cast a Spell  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Tangle Vine|Tangle Vine]].  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Soothing Blossoms|Soothing Blossoms]]."
