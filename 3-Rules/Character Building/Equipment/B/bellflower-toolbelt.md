description: "Different versions of the bellflower toolbelt are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  * * *  **Effect** You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single Interact action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as a [[Equipment/Artisan's Toolkit|Artisan's Toolkit]] for that trade."
