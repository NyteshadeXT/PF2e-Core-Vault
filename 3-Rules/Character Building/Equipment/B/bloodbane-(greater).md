description: "A _bloodbane_ clan dagger is especially vicious against the ancestral enemies of the clan. When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes 1d4 bleed. The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.  In addition, whenever you inflict persistent bleed damage with a _bloodbane_ weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude check save or become sickened 1. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour."
