description: "**Usage** affixed to a melee weapon  **Activate** `pf2:r` (concentrate)  **Prerequisites** You're an expert with the affixed weapon  **Trigger** A creature in reach of the weapon takes an action with the concentrate trait.  * * *  Brine dragons are known to distract their foes at just the right moment, and this blue-green scale appears to have come from one of these creatures. When you activate the scale, it cracks open and releases a spray of caustic saltwater at the triggering creature. The creature takes 2d8 acid damage with a DC 24 Reflex check save. If the creature critically fails at its save, its concentration is brokenâ€”the triggering action is disrupted."
