description: "The hilt of a bellicose dagger is etched with the word for 'war' in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A bellicose dagger is a _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[Striking|striking]] [[Wounding|wounding]] [[Dagger|dagger]]_. However, anytime you interact with creatures, no matter the context, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will check save or else find you have, as a reaction, drawn the dagger.<br><br>When you use the bellicose dagger as a weapon for the first time, it fuses to you. While it's in your possession, you take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks and skill checks to avoid fighting, such as [[Skills#Deception|Deception]] checks to trick your way out of a scuffle or Stealth checks to sneak past enemies."
