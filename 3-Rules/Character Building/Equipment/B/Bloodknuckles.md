description: "These thin cloth wraps, which are illegal to use in Highhelm's organized brawls, blend into the skin and add an edge to your blows. The wraps are _+1 striking [[Equipment/Wounding|Wounding]] handwraps of mighty blows_. When you invest the wraps, they gain the effects of a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Disguise Magic|Disguise Magic]] spell to appear non-magical and resemble simple bandages. Casual observers are unlikely to notice anything amiss with the wraps, but a creature that succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check check can notice something is off about them, though they would still need to find other means to discern the magical nature of the wraps.  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per minute;  **Trigger** You cause a creature within reach to take bleed damage  * * *  **Effect** You use your foe's pain to reinvigorate you. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the value of the triggering bleed damage, up to a maximum of 10 temporary HP. These temporary Hit Points remain for 1 minute."
