description: "This large tree branch is alive, despite having been harvested from the sugi tree it once belonged to. This long, flexible, and limber branch is a _+1 striking whip_. When used to Strike, the branch snaps with the sound of a cracking whip but fills the air surrounding the point of impact with the pleasant scent of freshly cut cedar and a sprinkling of fallen leaves on the ground.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:3` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You place the _branch of the great sugi_ on the corpse of an evil creature, then cause the branch to suddenly grow into a sugi tree, up to 25 feet tall with a 2-foot-wide trunk. As it grows, it emits a pulse of soothing energy, restoring 3d8+8 healing Hit Points to all creatures in a 10-foot burst. A character can Climb the tree with a successful DC 10 Athletics check check, and its branches effortlessly support the weight of any Medium or smaller creature. The sugi tree reverts to its whip form after 1 hour unless you transform it back before then.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  You transform the _branch of the great sugi_ from its tree form back into its whip form."
