mechanics1: "You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[striking]] [[Dagger]]_. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an [[Interact]] action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[Quick Draw]] feat.  Upgrading the runes on the blade byrnie makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|Weapon Potency +2]]_ rune if the armor has a _[[armor-potency-2|+2 armor potency]]_ rune, or a _[[Weapon Potency (+3)|Weapon Potency +3]]_ rune if the armor has a _[[armor-potency-3|+3 armor potency]]_ rune."
