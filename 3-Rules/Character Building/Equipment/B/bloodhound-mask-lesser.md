mechanics1: "Once activated, the mask sharpens odors, giving you imprecise scent with a 15 foot range. You can't wear other masks while you're wearing a bloodhound mask.  When you use Survival to [[Track]] a creature by its scent, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level even if you're untrained, and the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to your [[Skills#survival|Survival]] check. The GM sets the Survival DC based on the area's ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as normal for using scent."
