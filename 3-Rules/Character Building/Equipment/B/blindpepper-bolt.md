description: "**Ammunition** bolt  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude check save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe down its eyes.  **Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 minute.  **Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute."
