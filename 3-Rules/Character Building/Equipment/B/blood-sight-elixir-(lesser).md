description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  This thick, blood-red elixir sharpens your senses and makes you more acutely aware of blood. You gain blood sight as an imprecise sense with a duration of 10 minutes. Blood sight has a range of 60 feet and allows you to detect living creatures who are taking persistent bleed damage or who have the dying or wounded conditions. You also detect free-standing puddles or droplets of recently spilled blood. At the GM's discretion, living creatures without blood can't be detected with your blood sight."
