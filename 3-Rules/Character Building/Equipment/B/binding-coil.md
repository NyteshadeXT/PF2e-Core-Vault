description: "**Usage** affixed to a weapon  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** Your Strike with the affixed weapon damages a creature  **Requirements** You're an expert in Athletics.  * * *  This talisman, a bright red coil that's warm to the touch and faintly resembles a serpent, wraps entirely around your weapon. When you activate this talisman's effect, attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature you hit. On a success, rather than the normal Grapple effects, the coil instead wraps itself around the target with one end remaining attached to your weapon. Your opponent must succeed at a DC 20 Escape check to break free. The coil breaks if you move any further away from the bound opponent, but not if you move any closer."
