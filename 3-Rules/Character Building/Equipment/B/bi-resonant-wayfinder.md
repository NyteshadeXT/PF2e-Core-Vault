description: "This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called *Aeon Stone*. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe.<br><br>A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of aeon stones.  A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ works just like a regular [[3-Rules/Character Building/Equipment/W/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] except it has two aeon stone slots, and the aeon stones in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The _bi-resonant wayfinder_ and the two aeon stones count as two items toward your investiture limit."
