description: "A _greater breath blaster_ is a _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[blunderbuss]]_ most commonly crafted from the trachea of a dragon, though other creatures with breath attacks or the ability to spit energy are occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon's trachea allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.<br><br>A _breath blaster's_ Strikes deal either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon type or other creature from which it was made, though it can otherwise be used like a normal blunderbuss. A breath blaster also can be activated to fire a line of energy in a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone, chosen when it's created and typically corresponding to the shape of the breath attack used by the type of dragon or creature from which the _breath blaster was created._<br><br>In theory, the foundational techniques required to create a breath blaster would allow for other damage types, but such breath blasters would require the trachea from the correct dragon or creature type and additional creation techniques, making such a breath blaster rare rather than uncommon.
