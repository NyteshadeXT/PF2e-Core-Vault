description: "With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)]] [[battle axe]]_ is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A Strike with this axe that benefits from the sweep trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +3 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.  "
