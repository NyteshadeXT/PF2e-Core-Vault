description: "These brilliant golden bracers feature a hammer motif as part of their engravings. While wearing them, your body surges with strength and you gain a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Disarm]] and [[Trip]]. If you succeed, but not critically succeed, at your check to Disarm a creature, the effects of your check last until the start of your next turn, instead until the start of the target's turn. If you succeed at a check to Trip a creature, it takes `dice: 1d6` 1d6 bludgeoning damage or `dice: 4d6` 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a critical success. When you invest the bracers, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher score.  "

On a success, the creature is knocked [[Prone]] and takes `dice: 10d6` 10d6 bludgeoning damage (double on a critical hit). If you knock the creature prone, it must also attempt a DC 35 Reflex check save. On a failure, it drops any items it's holding."
