description: "This liquid contains blood from a black dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a black dragon's breath weapon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.  Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a 30-foot line of acid which deals 10d6 acid damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 Reflex check save.  After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds."
