description: "**Ammunition** any  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  Blister ammunition is loaded with alchemically processed irritants, such as pollen, pepper, and formic acid. A creature hit by activated blister ammunition must attempt a DC 35 Fortitude check save or begin to itch uncontrollably for 10 rounds in addition to damage the attack normally deals. On a critical hit, increase the Fortitude DC by 2 (DC 37 Fortitude check), and the target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. For the duration, each time the target attempts a concentrate action, it must attempt a DC 8 Flat check, losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single Interact action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 Interact actions scratching and sneezing. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive."
