description: "A specialized _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[Striking|striking]] [[Thundering|thundering]] [[probing-cane|probing cane]]_ made from strengthened spruce wood, a _batsbreath cane_ is distinctive for its brass tip.

mechanics1: "You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a precise sense."
