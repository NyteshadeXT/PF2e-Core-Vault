description: "This _+1 striking scythe_ is made from the cruel, blackened branches of the carnivorous scythe tree, which hungrily drink up spilled blood.  * * *  **Activate—Root in Blood** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike with this weapon and your target isn't currently taking any persistent bleed damage  **Effect** You break off a piece of the _bloodgorger scythe_ inside your enemy to feed on their blood and sprout into a new tree. The target takes 1 bleed damage at the end of their turn. Each failure to stop the bleeding increases this bleed damage by 1 as a small scythe tree grows from the wound, to a maximum of 3 persistent bleed damage.  * * *  **Activate—Sapling Slash** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Requirements** A target has a piece of the _bloodgorger scythe_ broken off inside them and has failed to recover from the persistent bleed damage for 3 consecutive turns  **Effect** The sprouted scythe tree grows large enough to be commanded. It makes a melee Strike against the target or a creature adjacent to the target, with a +18 to hit and dealing 1d10 slashing damage.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include branches and roots from a scythe tree."
