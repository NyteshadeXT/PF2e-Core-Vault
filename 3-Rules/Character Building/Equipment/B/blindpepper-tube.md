description: "This single-use pacification device consists of finely ground hot pepper loaded into a sealed, blowgun-style tube with a one-way valve and a range of 5 feet. To use it, the wielder must tear open the tube's seal as an [[Interact]] action, then spend another action to blow the hot pepper into an adjacent creature's face. These actions don't have to be taken in the same round. The target must attempt a DC 15 Reflex check save to avoid inhaling the pepper or getting it in their eyes. On a failed save, the creature is [[blinded]] for 1 round and then [[dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is [[blinded]] for 1 round, [[sickened|sickened 1]], and [[dazzled]] until it removes the sickened condition."
