description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Bitterblood elixir is a pale pink color, like that of water tinted by a few drops of blood. After you drink this elixir, your blood becomes dangerous for other creatures to consume. For the next hour, whenever a creature drinks your blood, the elixir changes your blood into a foul-tasting acid as it mixes with the drinker's saliva. You're unharmed by this transformation, but the blood drinker must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].  **Failure** The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].  **Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d6 acid + 2d6 persistent acid damage, and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]]."
