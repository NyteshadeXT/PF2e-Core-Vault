mechanics1: "If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is [[immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes, or could otherwise escape without effort."
