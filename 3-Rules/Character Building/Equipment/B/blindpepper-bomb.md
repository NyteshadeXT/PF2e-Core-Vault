All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex check save to avoid inhaling the dust or getting it in their eyes.  On a failed save, the creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and then [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.  On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round, [[Sickened|Sickened 1]], and dazzled until it removes the sickened condition."
