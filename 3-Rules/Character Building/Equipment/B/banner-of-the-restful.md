description: "Carried by knights who expect to spend the night in the open, this simple-looking banner is accompanied by a long cross pole from which it hangs. Usually, the banner appears to be a piece of plain cloth; when activated, it automatically adopts whatever insignia the person activating it desires.  **Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You plant the banner firmly in the ground, and a comfortable environment is created around it in a 20-foot radius. Those within the area are shielded against your choice of hot or cold temperatures, gaining the effects of 1st-rank [[Spells/Environmental Endurance|Environmental Endurance]]. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until it is removed from the ground.  As part of the activation, you can choose to ward the same area with an [[Spells/Alarm|Alarm]] spell. In addition to a mental alert for the person who Activates the banner, the alert sent by the _alarm_ spell also includes an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell, which has the auditory trait. You choose the password as you decide to ward the area."
