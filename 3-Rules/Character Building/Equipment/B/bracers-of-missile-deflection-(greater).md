description: "These bracers are made from plates of durable dawnsilver and gleam like the summer sun.  **Activate** `pf2:r` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once every 10 minutes  **Trigger** A ranged weapon attack hits you but doesn't critically hit  **Requirements** You are aware of the attack and not off-guard  * * *  **Effect** The bracers send the missile off-course. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If this would cause the attack to be a failure, the attack misses you.
