description: "Crafted from heavy steel plating and riveted together with cunning precision, this suit of +1 resilient [[Equipment/Full Plate|Full Plate]] is specifically designed to protect against sudden explosions. This added layer of security comes at the cost of movement, however.  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Trigger** You're affected by an area effect that requires a Reflex save, or you would take splash damage from a scatter weapon  * * *  **Effect** The _blast suit_ locks together into a rigid bulwark, protecting you from the blast but preventing you from moving from your position under any circumstances.  You become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the _blast suit_). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can Interact with the suit to unlock it.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Blast Suit|Effect: Blast Suit]]"
