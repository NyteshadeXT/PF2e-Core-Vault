description: "Crafted from heavy steel plating and riveted together with cunning precision, this suit of [[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[Resilient|resilient]] [[full-plate|Full Plate]] is specifically designed to protect against sudden explosions. This added layer of security comes at the cost of movement, however."

trigger1: "You're affected by an area effect that requires a Reflex save, or you would take splash damage from a scatter weapon"
mechanics1: "The _blast suit_ locks together into a rigid bulwark, protecting you from the blast but preventing you from moving from your position under any circumstances.  You become [[Immobilized]], gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the _blast suit_). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can [[Interact]] with the suit to unlock it."
