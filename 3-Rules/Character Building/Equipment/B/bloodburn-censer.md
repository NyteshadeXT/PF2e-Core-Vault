description: "The exterior of this egg-shaped brass censer is polished to a mirror-like sheen. Several rings are attached to its sides at regular intervals. The top of the censer's lid is decorated with a pair of intertwining snakes.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Light Incense** `pf2:2` (aura, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp  **Effect** A piping, reddish smoke pours from the censer in a 20-foot emanation. You choose whether the smoke causes the target's blood to turn extremely hot or transmutes to poison; the smoke deals your choice of fire or poison damage. Each living creature that's in the area or enters it attempts a DC 34 Fortitude check saving throw, then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature breathes in a small amount of the poisonous smoke and takes 2d6 persistent fire or 2d6 persistent acid damage.  **Failure** The creature gulps down a lungful of the smoke, taking 4d6 persistent fire or 4d6 persistent acid damage and becoming [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the persistent damage ends.  **Critical Failure** The creature inhales a large amount of the smoke, taking 6d6 persistent fire or 6d6 persistent acid damage and becoming [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] until the persistent damage ends."
