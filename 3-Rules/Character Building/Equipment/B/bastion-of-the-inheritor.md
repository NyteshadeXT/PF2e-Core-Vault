description: "Worn by Iomedae's prestigious knights, this _+2 resilient bastion plate_ is emblazoned with the Inheritor's religious symbol and sports a white cloak. While the cloak is white, this armor grants you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], provided your target has no enmity toward Iomedae.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  * * *  **Effect** The armor's cloak becomes red for 1 minute. As long as the cloak is red, you gain the benefits of the armor's deflect melee trait without needing to spend an additional action to activate it during each turn.  **Craft Requirements** You worship Iomedae."
