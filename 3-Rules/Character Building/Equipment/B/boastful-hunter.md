description: "Possessing a boisterous, proud demeanor, this _[[Weapon Potency (+1)|+1]] [[jezail]]_ is an aspiring big game hunter, always quick to share a tale of its bold adventures and predatory conquests—although the veracity of such tales is often questionable. A _boastful hunter_ enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous, or rare animals. Against an animal, the boastful hunter deals `dice: 1d6` 1d6 additional damage. On a critical hit against an animal, the boastful hunter also deals `dice: 1d6` 1d6 persistent bleed damage.\n\nA _boastful hunter_ urges you to face off against tougher and tougher creatures—a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be adequate to deal with. If the _boastful hunter_ goes one week without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least your level, it becomes bored. A bored _boastful hunter_ complains incessantly and imposes a –1 item penalty to attack rolls against non-animal targets. A bored _boastful hunter_ can be appeased by using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.\n\nUnable to accept its own weaknesses, a _boastful hunter_ blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted _boastful hunter_ badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact with, imposing a –1 item penalty to [[Skills#Deception|Deception]], [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], and [[Skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] skill checks, and all attacks with it incur a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted _boastful hunter_ can be appeased by complimenting it and succeeding at a DC 21 [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check check against its Will DC two days in a row. You can only attempt a [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to appease the _boastful hunter_ once each day."
