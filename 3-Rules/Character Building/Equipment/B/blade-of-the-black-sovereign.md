description: "This _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Shock|Shock]] greatsword_ is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet.  On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Effect** You cast the [[Spells/Electric Arc|Electric Arc]] cantrip from the sword as an 8th-rank primal spell, using 10 + your melee attack modifier with the _Blade of the Black Sovereign_ as your spell DC."
