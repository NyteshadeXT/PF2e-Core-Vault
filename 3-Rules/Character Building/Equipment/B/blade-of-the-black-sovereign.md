description: "This _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[Shock|Shock]] [[greatsword]]_ is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet.  On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[Off-Guard]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round."
