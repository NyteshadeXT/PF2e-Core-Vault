description: "This hand-polished pipe is carved from oak and releases small wisps of smoke even when unlit. As long as you're holding a vaporous pipe, you don't take a circumstance penalty to Perception checks due to thick smoke, and you can't suffocate from smoke and heated air (such as within a wildfire). As long as you are holding the pipe, you also gain resistance to fire equal to half your level.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You draw on the pipe and then blow a massive cloud of smoke that fills a 30-foot emanation that includes your space. All creatures within the smoke cloud are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from each other and from creatures outside the smoke, though you can still see clearly within it. The smoke dissipates after 3 rounds, or after 1 round if subjected to a strong wind."
