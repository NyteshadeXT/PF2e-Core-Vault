description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Vengeful demon's tears is an infamously noxious spirit mixed into a potent magical cocktail and traditionally packaged in a gourd adorned with an engraving of a terrifying demonic face. Drinking it feels akin to lighting your throat on fire and putting it out with an herbal tonic. When you activate this potion, you gain the [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] condition for 3 rounds and can use the extra action each round to Strike, Stride, or to take the following action.  * * *  **Release the Demon** `pf2:1` (concentrate, healing)  You focus on the sensation of life burning within your flesh and gain 2d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 round.
