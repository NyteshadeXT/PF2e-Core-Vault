description: "**Activate** `pf2:3` Interact  * * *  This specialized cream serves as a repellent to stave off insects.  The repellent also binds with a number of common insect venoms, dulling the potency and giving the wearer's immune system a boost to resist venoms.  Once applied to your skin, the repellent grants you a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poisons for 4 hours.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Vermin Repellent Agent|Effect: Vermin Repellent Agent]]  * * *  In addition, any arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals) must attempt a DC 24 Will check save when attempting to attack you with a melee Strike, or with a swarm attack such as the spider swarm's swarming bites. The arthropod then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature can act normally.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].  **Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2 and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]]."
