description: "Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, _vorpal_ weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Snicker-Snack** `pf2:r` (concentrate, death, incapacitation)  **Trigger** You roll a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon against a creature that has a head, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage.  **Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude check save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head."
