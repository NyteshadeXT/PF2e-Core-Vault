description: "This _+1 striking disrupting spiked chain_ comes in a rich, green color with rose petals painted on the handle in varying shades of red and pink. The chain seems to banish nearby shadows.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Effect** You hold the chain out before you, and the weapon glows as bright as a torch. You can suppress this light by Activating the weapon again.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike against a fiend or undead  **Effect** The weapon unleashes its light in an attempt to destroy the target. The _vine of roses_ casts a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]] spell with the triggering creature as the target. In place of a spell attack roll, make a weapon attack roll with the _vine of roses_ using the same multiple attack penalty as the triggering Strike."
