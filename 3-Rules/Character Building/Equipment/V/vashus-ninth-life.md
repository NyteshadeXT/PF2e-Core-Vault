description: "This _+1 striking ghost touch katana_ is made from a whisker stolen from the king of cats over three hundred years ago by a catfolk rogue named Vashu Vigaru. He sought the magic of the whisker to preternaturally extend his life, and some believe he still lives, having successfully divested himself of the sword to escape the king's wrath in the end.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` (envision)  **Trigger** Your turn ends  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You extend your senses through the blade, allowing you to react to nearby movement. _Vashu's Ninth Life_ gains the parry trait and raises itself into parrying position, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Vashu's Ninth Life|Effect: Vashu's Ninth Life]]  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` (envision)  **Trigger** You slay a living creature with _Vashu's Ninth Life_  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** A portion of the slain creature's life force travels through the blade and into your soul, bolstering your own life. You gain the benefits of the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] feat for 1 minute. This causes you to die from the dying condition at dying 5 rather than dying 4.
