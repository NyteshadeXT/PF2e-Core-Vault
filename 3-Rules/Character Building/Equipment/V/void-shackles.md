description: "_Void shackles_ are built from supernatural crystals that form in the Void—materials that dig painfully into the flesh of those they restrain. A set of _void shackles_ functions as superior manacles, but while they are in the Void, the crystals fluctuate in response to the plane's energy, which increases all DCs to remove them or [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] by 1 to DC 43. If a check to remove _void shackles_ from a creature fails, the wearer of the manacles takes 10d6 void damage (DC 37 Fortitude check save). While a creature is manacled, the _void shackles_ attempt to counteract any teleportation effect that targets the manacled creature, with a counteract rank of 9th and a +25 modifier to the roll. If the teleportation effect is countered, the manacled creature takes 10d6 void damage (DC 37 Fortitude check save).  Void shackles can be placed on incorporeal creatures as if they were not incorporeal. An incorporeal creature manacled by _void shackles_ cannot pass through solid objects. Even a soul can be [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] via _void shackles_, provided the soul was of a 17th- or lower-level creature in life. A soul held in _void shackles_ cannot move on to the afterlife, cannot become undead, and can be transported by simply transporting the shackles.  **Activate—Affix Shackle** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** You affix the _void shackles_ to a helpless or willing creature or to any 17th- or lower-level soul. The shackles grow in size to accommodate the wrists or ankles of any size creature.  **Activate—Release Shackle** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  * * *  **Effect** You cause the _void shackles_ to open and release their prisoner. If you were not the one to affix the shackles to that creature or soul, you must attempt a DC 43 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The shackles open.  **Success** The shackles open, but you and the shackled creature take 5d6 void damage.  **Failure** The shackles do not open, and you and the shackled creature take 10d6 void damage.  **Critical Failure** As failure, but 20d6 void damage."
