description: "This elegant toga is infused with inexhaustible energy to enjoy life possessed by azatas. You gain resistance to poison 20 and become immune to [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]]. When you invest in the robes, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. If you are unholy, you become deafened while wearing the toga.  * * *  **Activate—Elysium's Gasp** `pf2:r` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You are exposed to an inhaled poison  **Effect** Purifying gusts of sweet-scented air swirl around you, making you immune to inhaled poisons for 1 minute.  * * *  **Activate—Elysium's Breath** 1 minute (concentrate, healing)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** The air around the robe constantly circulates to keep you healthy. For 8 hours, you become immune to diseases spread via inhalation, olfactory effects, and environmental effects that would prevent you from breathing (including being underwater or from being strangled)."
