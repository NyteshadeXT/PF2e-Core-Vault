description: "Chronicler wayfinders bear a mystical connection to the Pathfinder Chronicles themselves, granting them the ability to assist in situations where unusual lore is needed by drawing on lore from a particular topic. Each chronicler wayfinder is attuned to a specific Lore skill, chosen at the time of creation. In addition to the effects of a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]], a chronicler wayfinder has the following activation.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` Envision  * * *  **Effect** You tap into the Pathfinder Chronicles on the chronicler wayfinder's attuned topic, gaining the effects of a Recall Knowledge action with the chosen Lore skill. For the Lore check's modifier, use whichever is better of +12 or your own modifier, using your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained in the attuned Lore skill."
