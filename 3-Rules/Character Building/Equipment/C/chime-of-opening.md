description: "This hollow dawnsilver tube is about a foot long and bears engravings reminiscent of open locks and broken chains. The chime can be activated 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You aim the chime at a container, door, or lock you want to open and strike the chime. The chime sends out magical vibrations that attempt a Thievery check against the lock's DC, with a Thievery bonus of 1d20+13. This targets only one lock or binding at a time, so you might need to activate the chime multiple times to open a target with several forms of protection."
