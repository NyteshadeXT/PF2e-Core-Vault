mechanics1: "You aim the chime at a container, door, or lock you want to open and strike the chime. The chime sends out magical vibrations that attempt a [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check against the lock's DC, with a [[Skills#Thievery|Thievery]] bonus of `dice: 1d20+13` 1d20+13. This targets only one lock or binding at a time, so you might need to activate the chime multiple times to open a target with several forms of protection."
