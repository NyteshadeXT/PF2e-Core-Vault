description: "This stylized, palm-sized box contains a black, ooze-like substance that can easily devour a corpse in moments, breaking the body down into a necromantic sludge.  **Activate** Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You feed a corpse of a Small-sized or larger creature to the cask, little by little. The activation requires a three-action activity for a Small or Medium creature, a 1-minute activity for a Larger creature, and a 10-minute activity for a Huge creature. A Gargantuan creature is too large for the cask to devour.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:D` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** The carrion cask has consumed a corpse since the last time it was activated  * * *  **Effect** You release the sludge from the carrion cask's last meal in a pulse of necromantic energy. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 6d6 void damage, with a DC 24 Fortitude check."
