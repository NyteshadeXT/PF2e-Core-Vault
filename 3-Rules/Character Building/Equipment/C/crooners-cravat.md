description: "This long, silky neckcloth has the ability to be tied into a convincing semblance of an elegant evening scarf, a worker's neck kerchief, an elaborate cravat, or any other neckwear. It also provides a boost to vocal performances, enhancing both projection and the emotive qualities of a performance. In its natural state, this item appears as a long, white silk scarf. A _crooner's cravat_ grants a +1 item bonus to all Performance checks, but this increases to a +2 item bonus for Performance checks to sing.  **Activate—Adjust Cravat** `pf2:2` (illusion, manipulate, visual)  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You make adjustments to the crooner's cravat, transforming it into any type of stylish chosen neckwear; as you do so, you cast a 1st-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] on yourself.  **Activate—Influential Croon** `pf2:2` (auditory, emotion, linguistic)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You pour emotion into your vocal performance, projecting an empathetic bond that fascinates listeners. You cast enthrall (DC 30 Will check save). When you first activate Influential Croon, you can also cast [[Spells/Subconscious Suggestion|Subconscious Suggestion]] on one creature within 30 feet (DC 30 Will check save)."
