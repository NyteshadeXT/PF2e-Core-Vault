description: "One dueling pistol in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the _Coldstar Pistols_ functions as a _+3 greater striking greater flaming dueling pistol_ and the other as a _+3 greater striking greater frost dueling pistol_. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a _+4 major striking greater flaming greater frost dueling pistol._ The combined form has a range increment of 120 feet. In either form, the _Coldstar Pistols_ have the agile, concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. As star guns, the _Coldstar Pistols_ run on magic and don't use ammunition or black powder.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You switch the _Coldstar Pistols_ from one form to the other. Attempt a Deception check to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] with a +4 circumstance bonus.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per round  * * *  **Effect** Make two Strikes against one target, taking the highest of the two attack rolls and applying it to both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty increases only after these Strikes.  **Destruction** If Deft Onki's name and deeds ever fade from mortal memory entirely, the _Coldstar Pistols_ can be destroyed like a normal object."
