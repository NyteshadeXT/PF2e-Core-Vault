description: "One dueling pistol in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the _Coldstar Pistols_ functions as a _[[Weapon Potency (+3)|+3]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[flaming-(greater)|greater flaming]] [[dueling pistol]]_ and the other as a _[[Weapon Potency (+3)|+3]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[frost-(greater)|greater frost]] [[dueling pistol]]_. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a _[[Weapon Potency (+3)|+4]] [[striking-(major)|major striking]] [[flaming-(greater)|greater flaming]] [[frost-(greater)|greater frost]] [[dueling pistol]]._ The combined form has a range increment of 120 feet. In either form, the _Coldstar Pistols_ have the agile, concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. As star guns, the _Coldstar Pistols_ run on magic and don't use ammunition or black powder."
