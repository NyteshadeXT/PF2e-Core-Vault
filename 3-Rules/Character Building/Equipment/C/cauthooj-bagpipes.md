description: "The main portion of this set of bagpipes is fashioned from the dried skin of a cauthooj, with the feathers still attached. The bird's vocal cords are crafted into the instrument's reeds. The pipes grant a +2 item bonus to Performance checks while playing music with them.  * * *  **Activate—Disorienting Fugue** `pf2:2`(auditory, incapacitation, manipulation, mental)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You play several notes on the pipes, quickly altering their pitch and tone. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation must attempt a DC 31 Will check save to resist the song. Creatures that attempt this save become temporarily immune to Disorienting Fugue for 1 minute.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and its temporary immunity to Disorienting Fugue increases to 1 hour.  **Success** The target is unaffected.  **Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round.  **Critical Failure** The target is confused for 1 round and immediately attacks itself (in the normal fashion for attacking oneself while confused). This Strike doesn't give the creature a flat check to recover from the confusion.  * * *  **Activate—Throw Song** `pf2:r` (auditory, mental)  **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet attempts a melee Strike against you or an ally  **Effect** You let loose a staccato chirp from the pipes that appears to come from somewhere else. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 31 Will check save. On a failure, the creature redirects the Strike to another creature of your choice within reach of the melee Strike. If no other creatures are within range, the affected creature instead takes a –2 penalty to the Strike.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the skin and vocal cords of a cauthooj."
