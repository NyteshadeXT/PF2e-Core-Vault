description: "This translucent, pale-yellow drink has several pepper seeds suspended within it. Although the tonic is painfully spicy when first consumed, the heat soon fades as the tonic coats your throat. In the next hour, you can use the activation below up to three times; the third time you use it, the effects of the capsaicin tonic end. While under the effects of the tonic, you can easily consume even the spiciest of foods without trouble.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You belch out a foul-smelling cloud of blisteringly spicy gas that fills a single square adjacent to you. Creatures within the cloud are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud are concealed to creatures within it. The cloud remains for 1 minute but can be dispersed by a strong wind. The cloud deals 1d4 fire damage to creatures that enter the cloud on their turn, as well as to creatures that start their turn in the cloud (a creature takes this damage no more than once per round, even if it moves back and forth into the cloud multiple times during the round)."
