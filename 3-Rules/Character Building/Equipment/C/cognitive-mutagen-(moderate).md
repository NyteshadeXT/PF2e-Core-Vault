description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Your mind becomes clear, but physical matters seem ephemeral.  **Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks and all checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead.  **Drawback** You take a -2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, Athletics checks, and acrobatics checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.  **Duration** 10 minutes.
