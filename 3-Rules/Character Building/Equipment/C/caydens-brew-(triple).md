description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Cayden's brew is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude check saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.  **Failure** The creature is clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.  **Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]], and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. The clumsy and stupefied conditions last until 1d4 rounds after the sickened condition ends.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Cayden's Brew|Effect: Cayden's Brew]]"
