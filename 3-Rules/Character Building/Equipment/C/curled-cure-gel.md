description: "**Activate** [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]  * * *  Curled cure secretes a gel that gently warms the skin and stimulates healing. You can Activate the item as part of the same activity you use to Treat Wounds. If you successfully Treat Wounds, you can also reduce the value of one of the targets' [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] conditions by 1. The target of your Treat Wounds is then temporarily immune to curled cure gel for 24 hours, whether or not your attempt to Treat Wounds was successful."
