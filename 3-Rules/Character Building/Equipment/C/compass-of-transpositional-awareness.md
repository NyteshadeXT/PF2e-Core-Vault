description: "The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` concentrate, Interact  **Frequency** once per minute  **Effect** You point the compass of transpositional awareness at an extant teleportation effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a teleportation effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast dimension door). Attempt an Occultism check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the teleportation effect (for example "the Plane of Fire," "north," or "Avistan"). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or interdimensional portals).  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You use the compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet."
