description: "The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations."
powerTitle1: "Teleport"
actionEconomy1: 1
type1: "([[concentrate]], [[Interact]])"
frequency1: "once per minute"
trigger1:
mechanics1: "You point the compass of transpositional awareness at an extant teleportation effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a teleportation effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast dimension door). Attempt an [[Skills#Occultism|Occultism]] check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the teleportation effect (for example 'the Plane of Fire,' or 'north'). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or interdimensional portals)."
powerTitle2: "Extend"
actionEconomy2: 1
type2:
frequency2: "once per day"
trigger2:
mechanics2: "You use the compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet."
