description: "This charm, normally hung from the belt or worn around the neck, grants you resistance 10 against one type of energy damage: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each charm is crafted to protect against a particular type of energy damage, and its design usually embodies the type of energy it protects the wearer from in some way. For instance, a _charm of cold resistance_ could be carved in the shape of a yeti, whereas a _charm of fire resistance_ would be made from volcanic glass."
