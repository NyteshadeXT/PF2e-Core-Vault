description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Made from several oils of differing hues extracted from jellyfish and rare plants, the layers of chromatic jellyfish oil stack to form a rainbow within their vial. For 10 minutes after consuming chromatic jellyfish oil, you gain resistance 5 to precision damage and extra damage from critical hits. While the effect lasts, you ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren't tight enough to force you to [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeeze]], and you can move 5 feet per round when you successfully Squeeze (or 10 feet per round on a critical success). You can also [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] at half your Speed.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Chromatic Jellyfish Oil|Effect: Chromatic Jellyfish Oil]]"
