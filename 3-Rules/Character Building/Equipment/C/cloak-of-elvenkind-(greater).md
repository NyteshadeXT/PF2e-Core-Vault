description: "This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell.  When you adjust the cloak's clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of a 4th-rank [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]], with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.  If you're also wearing [[Equipment/Boots of Elvenkind|Boots of Elvenkind]], you can activate this ability twice per day, and it allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing you."
