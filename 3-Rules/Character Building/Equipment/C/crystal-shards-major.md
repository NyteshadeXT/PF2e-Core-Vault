description: "This flask holds a pressurized red-brown gas flecked with bits of sublimated crystal. You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. When the bomb explodes, it deals `dice; 4d4` piercing damage and 6 piercing splash damage as the mixture suddenly turns into solid crystals flying at high speeds.  On a hit, the target takes 1 persistent bleed damage from the crystals embedded in its flesh. As long as the bleed damage persists, the target also takes a –5-foot penalty to its speed. The target can spend an Interact action to remove the crystals, reducing the DC to stop the bleeding."
