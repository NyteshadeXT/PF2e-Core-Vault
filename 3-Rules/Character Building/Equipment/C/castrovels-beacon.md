description: "The tip of this _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[brilliant]] [[Cold Iron Ingot|standard-grade cold iron]] [[rapier]]_ shines with a flickering sheen of green light that mimics the glittering appearance of Castrovel in the night sky. The carrier of _Castrovel's Beacon_ instinctively knows Castrovel's position in the sky even if it hasn't actually yet risen into view, which grants the wielder a +2 item bonus to [[Sense Direction]] when using the stars to orient themself. Additionally, the weapon grants a +2 item bonus to all saving throws against effects that cause the [[Dazzled]] or [[Blinded]] conditions.<br><br>When its _brilliant_ rune is activated, the counteract rank is 6 and the counteract modifier is +21.
