For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 31 Fortitude check saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for `dice: 1d4` 1d4 rounds.<br><br>**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.<br>**Success** The creature is [[Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.<br>**Failure** The creature is clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.<br>**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]], and [[Sickened|Sickened 1]].
