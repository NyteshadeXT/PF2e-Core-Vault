description: "Fulcrum lenses are unique magical crystals that each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth's essence. They belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four of the lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth's attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the Fulcrum Lattice to hold the lenses so that their power could be focused together. She realized the danger of keeping the fulcrum lenses too close together until the right time and spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults' lowest levels for safekeeping.<br><br>Belcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the Ebon Fulcrum Lens, with her—indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.<br><br>The fulcrum lenses are more than mere receptacles of Nhimbaloth's essence. Each grants those who use it a fragment of the Great Old One's power.<br><br>This concave lens has a drifting crimson cloud resembling slowly swirling blood within it. While you have the _Crimson Fulcrum Lens_ invested, you seethe with malevolent fury you can barely contain. You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects and a +2 item bonus to your melee Strike damage (this increases to a +4 item bonus to damage if the melee Strike is a jaws attack). You can also activate the lens in the following ways."

mechanics1: "You grasp the _Crimson Fulcrum Lens_ in one hand and make a Strike that doesn't require that hand. The Strike deals an additional `dice: 1d8` precision damage (or `dice: 2d8` precision damage if you make a jaws Strike) and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty."
powerTitle2: "Effect"
actionEconomy2: 2
type2: "([[interact]] (attack, possession))"
frequency2:
trigger2:
mechanics2: "While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +18. On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens."
