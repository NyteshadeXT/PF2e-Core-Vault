description: "This gleaming golden sword is a _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[holy]] cold iron [[longsword]]_ given only to the worthiest heroes of a holy faith. It's made of a sacred, secret alloy that makes the blade both cold iron and silver. If you're unholy, you're [[Drained|Drained 2]] while holding a _chalice of justice_. You can't recover from this condition while holding the weapon.  "

If you're holy, you regain double the HP, and for 1 minute, whenever you critically hit an unholy creature with the _chalice of justice_, the creature takes `dice: 2d6` 2d6 persistent spirit damage, and it's [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. The persistent spirit damage has the holy trait."
