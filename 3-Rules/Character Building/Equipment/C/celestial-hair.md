description: "**Usage** affixed to armor  **Activate** `pf2:0` Interact  **Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack  This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note.  The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will check saving throw or be [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until the end of its next turn."
