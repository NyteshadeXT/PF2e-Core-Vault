description: "This bone compass, made of the bones of sapient creatures that died violent deaths, is eerily effective when it comes to locating corpses. If you know you're [[Actions/Track|Tracking]] a creature that's dead, you can use the compass's idiosyncrasies to your advantage and gain a +2 item bonus to your Survival check to do so. Otherwise, it works as a normal [[Equipment/Compass|Compass]]."
