description: "You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place. This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] check against an illusion, you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your _bargained contract_ can overwhelm your cryolite eye with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [[Dazzled]] condition on you for 1 minute."
