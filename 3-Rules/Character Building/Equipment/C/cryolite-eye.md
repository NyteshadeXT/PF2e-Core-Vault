description: "You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place. This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a Perception check against an illusion, you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your _bargained contract_ can overwhelm your cryolite eye with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition on you for 1 minute.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You look through the glass eye sealing your _bargained contract_. The contract casts [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] affecting you."
