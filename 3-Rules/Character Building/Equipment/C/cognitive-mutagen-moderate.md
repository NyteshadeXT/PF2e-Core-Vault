description: "Your mind becomes clear, but physical matters seem ephemeral. For ten minutes you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Skills#Arcana|Arcana]], [[Skills#Crafting|Crafting]], [[Skills#Lore|Lore]], [[Skills#Occultism|Occultism]], and [[Skills#Society|Society]] checks and all checks to [[Recall Knowledge]]. Your critical failures on [[Recall Knowledge]] checks become failures instead. You take a -2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks, and [[Skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4."
