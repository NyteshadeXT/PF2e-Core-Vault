description: "From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this _[[Weapon Potency (+3)|+3]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[holy]] [[vitalizing]] [[peachwood]] [[shortsword]]_ has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undeadâ€”if you are willing to pay the price.  An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a Strike with the sword takes `dice: 10d6` 10d6 vitality damage with a DC 35 Fortitude check save. This damage is separate from the Strike itself and isn't included in any effect based on the Strike's damage.  "
