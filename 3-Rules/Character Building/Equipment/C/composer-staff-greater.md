description: "A _composer staff_ is short and shaped like an elegant black conductor's baton with a silver tip. When waved through the air, it hums melodically. In this way, you can play it as though it were an instrument, and it grants a +1 item bonus to [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] checks made with it."
