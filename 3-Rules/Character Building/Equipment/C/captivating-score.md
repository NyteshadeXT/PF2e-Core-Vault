description: "A captivating score is a piece of parchment prepared for musical notation, long enough for a short song. You must be trained in [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] to properly compose this missive (or trained in an appropriate Lore skill your GM allows). You choose one of the emotions described below and write a musical composition to convey that emotion about a subject of your choice, typically a person or group. When activated, the missive plays a note-perfect rendition of the inscribed score. Each creature that can hear the score must succeed at a DC 28 Will check save or be influenced to feel the emotion you chose toward the subject of your composition. This lasts for 1 hour, typically returning the creature to its initial attitude unless new events have altered their attitude long-term.<br><br>**Positive** Your song engenders sympathy, adoration, joy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject improves by one step, such as from indifferent to friendly.<br>**Negative** Your song spurs anger, sadness, jealousy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject worsens by one step, such as from indifferent to unfriendly.<br><br>When composing this missive, you can add a small notation or illustration of a type of instrument. If you do, the music sounds like that instrument, and if you didn't specify, it sounds vaguely like a recorder. The choice of a louder instrument doesn't make the music carry farther."
