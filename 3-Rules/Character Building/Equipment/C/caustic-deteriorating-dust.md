description: "Contained in a specially enchanted small leather or hide sack, _deteriorating dust_ is a potent caustic agent and a prized item among Rovagug's more discreet followers.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You sprinkle the _deteriorating dust_ over an unattended Medium or smaller object. The dust quickly fades to a transparent color and the object immediately begins to rust, melt, or otherwise fall apart. For the listed time, the object takes constant damage; if the object has a Hardness, then the dust gradually reduces the object's Hardness instead. If the _deteriorating dust_ is still active after the object's Hardness is reduced to 0, it deals damage to the object as previously described. If the object survives, reduced Hardness returns after the dust's duration expires, but any damage remains.  The affected object takes 1 damage per hour (24 damage per day) and its Hardness is reduced by 1 per hour. The effect lasts for 3 days."
