description: "Named because of its popularity among thieves to distract any authorities in pursuit, a _captivating rosebud_ has a near-irresistible fragrance.  * * *  **Activate - Scent of Roses** `pf2:1` (manipulate, mental, olfactory)  **Effect** You throw the captivating rosebud in a square adjacent to you. The rosebud quickly sprouts into a little rosebush that lasts for 1 hour. Any creature that passes within 15 feet of the rose bush, other than yourself, must attempt a DC 18 Will check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 10 minutes.  **Failure** As success, but a –2 penalty.  **Critical Failure** As success, but a –2 penalty and the creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the rosebush.  * * *  **Activate - Rose Vines** 10 minutes (manipulate)  **Effect** You plant the captivating rosebud into a square adjacent to a building or other structure. It grows into a rosebush that stretches up to 30 feet tall. You and your allies can use the rosebush as a ladder to Climb easily up and down the side of the adjacent structure, but all other creatures must succeed at a DC 17 Will check saving throw or fail to notice the rosebush's presence."
