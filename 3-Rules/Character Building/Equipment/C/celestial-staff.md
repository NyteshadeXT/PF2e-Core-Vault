Used as a weapon, the staff is a _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[holy]] [[staff]]_. While wielding a _celestial staff_, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the evil trait and effects created by evil creatures. When you prepare this staff, if you're evil, you become [[Drained|Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.  "
