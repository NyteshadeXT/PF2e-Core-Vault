description: "This _[[Weapon Potency (+2)|+2]] [[striking-(greater)|greater striking]] [[grievous]] [[sawtooth saber]]_ has a red hilt and a purple-black blade. Favored by Red Mantis assassins who enjoy using illusions to confound their targets, a _crimson bluff_ constantly flickers and flashes, creating brief afterimages that can be quite distracting. If you use a _crimson bluff_ as part of a gesture when you [[Create a Diversion]], you gain a +2 item bonus to your [[Skills#Deception|Deception]] check."
