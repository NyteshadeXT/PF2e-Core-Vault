mechanics1: "You focus on your environment and the creatures around you to see them as they really are. The GM rolls a secret counteract check using your [[Skills#Perception|Perception]] bonus against any illusion effect created by a 6th-rank or lower spell or a creature of 13th level or lower. You must be able to see the illusion, and it must be within 60 feet. If the check succeeds, you see through the illusion for 10 minutes.  The Item Level determines the counteract rank, not the character level."
