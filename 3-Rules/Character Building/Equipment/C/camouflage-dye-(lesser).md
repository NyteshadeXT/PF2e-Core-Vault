description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Camouflage dye uses a variety of alchemically treated paints and crushed crystals to make the user particularly hard to distinguish from their surroundings. When you Activate the dye by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, the target and its clothing change colors, blending into their surroundings until the target makes a sudden movement. The target can [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] without cover or concealment for 10 minutes. If the target uses a hostile action or moves at more than half its Speed, after that action is completed, the effects of camouflage powder end and the creature ceases to be [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or undetected."
