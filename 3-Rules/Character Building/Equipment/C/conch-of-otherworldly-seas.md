description: "Magical writing covers the surface of this beautiful conch shell, which emits a blue light from inside. A _conch of otherworldly seas_ is a virtuoso handheld musical instrument that grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks attempted while using it.<br><br>The conch is a planar key for [[Interplanar Teleport]] and similar magic to travel to the Plane of Water. When using it this way, you can attune it to the waters of your destination to make it more likely to arrive where you intend to be, appearing `dice: 1d6*25` 1d6×25 miles from your intended destination instead of 1d10×25 miles away."
