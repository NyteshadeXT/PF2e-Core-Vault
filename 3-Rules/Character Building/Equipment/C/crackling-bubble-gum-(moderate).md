description: "This tangy gum cracks and pops in your mouth as you chew it. While you're chewing crackling bubble gum, for up to 10 minutes, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against auditory and sonic effects.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Crackling Bubble Gum|Effect: Crackling Bubble Gum]]  **Secondary Effect** `pf2:2` (sonic)  * * *  **Effect** You blow a bubble with the gum until it pops, after which it becomes inert. The pop deals 6d4 sonic to all creatures in a 15-foot cone with a DC 25 Fortitude check save. A creature that fails its save is also bound with sticky gum, taking a â€“10-foot item penalty to its Speed for 1 minute. The creature can remove the gum with a total of 3 Interact actions. These actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Crackling Bubble Gum (Failure)|Effect: Crackling Bubble Gum (Failure)]]"
