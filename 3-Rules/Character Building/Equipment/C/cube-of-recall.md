mechanics2: "While speaking a word of command and bringing the location into your mind, you push the corresponding side of the cube. You teleport to the location attuned to the side you press, within 100 feet of the attuned location, as long as that location is on the same planet. If it's not, your activation produces no effect, but the attunement remains."
