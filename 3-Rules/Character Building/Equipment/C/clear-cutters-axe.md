trigger2:
mechanics2: "You hurl the axe horizontally, sending it flying through the air in a wild, whirling cyclone. The axe flies in a 30-foot emanation around you, eliminating all non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment in area. It attempts to counteract one magical effect that affects a plant in the area (counteract +20). Plant creatures in the area take `dice: 5d6` 5d6 slashing damage (DC 25 Reflex check save). As the axe finishes its circuit, it returns to your hand."
