description: "This [[tower shield]] is composed of interlocking hexagonal wooden tiles lined with metal. The tiles are painted a verdant green, and each is marked with a faded rune that protects against curses. While you have this shield raised, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that target you, increasing to a +2 circumstance bonus against curses. You can unleash the energy stored in the shield to destroy a curse before it can affect you."
