description: "In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of Nethys discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters. The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.  This pack contains 24 cards-one of each cantrip in the Core Rulebook.  "

mechanics1: "You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-rank spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.<br><br>[[Acid Splash]], [[Void Warp]], [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/L/Light|Light]], [[Daze]], [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/D/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]], [[Vitality Lash]], [[Divine Lance]], [[Electric Arc]], [[Forbidding Ward]], [[Ghost Sound]], [[Guidance]], [[Know the Way]], [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/L/Light|Light]], [[Telekinetic Hand]], [[Message]], [[Prestidigitation]], [[Ignition]], [[Ray of Frost]], [[Read Aura]], [[Shield]], [[Sigil]], [[Stabilize]], [[Tangle Vine]], [[Telekinetic Projectile]]"
