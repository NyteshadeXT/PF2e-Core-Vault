description: "An elegant accoutrement for a witch who has come into the higher echelons of power, a _crown of witchcraft_ typically looks like a garland of flowering twigs, a jeweled circlet, or a tall hat of fine fabric. You gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks, and if you're a witch, you gain a +2 item bonus to your patron skill.  If you have a familiar, you can attach a small portion of the crown's material to your familiar, such as a strip of fabric from a hat tied around its tail or a sprig of natural material linked to its collar; the familiar doesn't need to invest the item itself. If you do this, your familiar gains the tough pet ability as long as the crown is invested by you.  **Activateâ€”Defiant Hex** `pf2:0` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** Gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a witch hex spell. If you don't spend this point by the end of this turn, it is lost.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You are a witch."
