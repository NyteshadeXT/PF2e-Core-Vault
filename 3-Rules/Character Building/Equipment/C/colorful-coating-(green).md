description: "**Activate** `pf2:3` Interact  These coatings come in different colors, each with a different special effect. A bottle of colorful coating contains enough to slather over one 5-foot square within your reach or space and is made with a special dispenser that enables you to coat the surface using only one hand. It's possible to use the coating on any surface that can be painted (subject to the GM's discretion). Colorful coating dries instantly, and its effect in the square you coated lasts for 1 minute. After that time, the coating turns to fine, inert powder, returning the square to its original condition unless otherwise noted.  Green colorful coating dries into a low-friction surface. It makes the square slippery, making it both difficult terrain and uneven ground with a DC to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] of 20. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt to Balance.  The coating also makes a coated wall or ceiling harder to climb. It imposes a +2 circumstance penalty to checks to Climb the coated surface.  Yellow colorful coating and green colorful coating have opposite effects. If they're both applied to the same surface, they negate one another."
