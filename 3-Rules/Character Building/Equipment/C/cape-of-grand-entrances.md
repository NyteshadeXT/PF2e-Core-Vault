description: "This regal blue cape is crafted from a hefty yet elegant velvet embroidered with ornate silver stars and dragons. Falling in a cascade of fabric, the cape rustles and flows in all the right ways and hangs upon your shoulders in a way that flatters your form and figure. You draw the eyes of those around you and gain a +2 item bonus to your [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] checks.  "
