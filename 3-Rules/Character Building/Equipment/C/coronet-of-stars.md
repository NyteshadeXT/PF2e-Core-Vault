description: "This short golden crown bears a number of gems, each placed in the center of an engraving of a star. While wearing the crown, you are overcome with a nurturing instinct and understand the best ways to help others. You gain a +3 item bonus to Medicine checks. When you invest the crown, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.  **Activate** `pf2:r` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** A living creature within 60 feet would die  **Effect** You reach out to the creature with a lifeline. The triggering creature receives the effects of [[Spells/Breath of Life|Breath of Life]], except they recover 7d8 healing Hit Points.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` command  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** An ally within 60 feet fails a non-secret check  * * *  **Effect** You call out to your ally and offer a reassurance. The triggering ally rerolls the failed check and takes the higher result. This is a fortune effect."
