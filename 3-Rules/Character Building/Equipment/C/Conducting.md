description: "A conducting weapon can channel energy through it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon trait, except that when you [[Conduct Energy]], the weapon deals an additional `dice: 1d8` 1d8 damage of the selected type instead of 1 additional damage per die; if the weapon already had the resonant weapon trait, it deals `dice: 1d8` 1d8 damage plus 1 damage per die instead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals `dice: 1d8` 1d8 persistent damage of the same type."
