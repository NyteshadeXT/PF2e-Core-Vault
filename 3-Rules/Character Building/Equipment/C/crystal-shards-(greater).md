description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  * * *  This flask holds a pressurized red-brown gas flecked with bits of sublimated crystal. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. When the bomb explodes, it deals 3d4 piercing damage and 5 piercing splash damage as the mixture suddenly turns into solid crystals flying at high speeds.  On a hit, the target takes 1 persistent bleed damage from the crystals embedded in its flesh. As long as the bleed damage persists, the target also takes a â€“5-foot penalty to its speed. The target can spend an Interact action to remove the crystals, reducing the DC to stop the bleeding."
