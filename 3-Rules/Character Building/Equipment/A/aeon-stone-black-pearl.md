description: "Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.  When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.  There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_.<br><br>This black pearl sparkles with light.   "

type: ([[envision]])
frequency:
trigger1: "you are targeted by a mental effect"
mechanics1: "You receive a +4 status bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect.  Whether or not your save is successful, the aeon stone attempts a counteract check at `dice: 1d20+30` 1d20+30 to immediately reflect a copy of the effect back at the originator, targeting it using the creature's own relevant statistics but controlling the effect as if you had cast it.  Every time you activate this aeon stone, attempt a DC 5 Flat check. On a failure, the stone shatters and loses its magical properties forever."
