description: "This coin-sized gemstone can be used on its own but must be included in the construction of a hearth in order to fully activate its magic."
powerTitle1: "Effect"

type1: "([[Interact]])"
frequency1: "4 times per year"
trigger1:
requirement1: "You have Legendary proficiency in Crafting"
activate1: "3 days"
mechanics1: "You craft a magical weapon or armor of up to 20th level. You must attempt a [[Skills#Crafting|Crafting]] check as usual to create the item, but you need supply only raw materials worth a quarter of the item's Price, and you need not pay the remaining portion of the item's Price or spend additional downtime days working on it. While _Aroden's Hearthstone_ is active, the stars in the sky, including Golarion's sun, appear to glow brighter within a 100-mile radius of the hearthstone."
powerTitle2: "Effect"
actionEconomy2: 3
type2: "([[command]], [[envision]])"
frequency2: "once per month"
trigger2:
mechanics2: "_Aroden's Hearthstone_ draws in heat from the world itself, causing the ambient temperature within 100 miles to drop below 0°F. Within 1 mile of the _Hearthstone_, the temperature drops to -200°F, rivaling the frigid cold of outer space and dealing `dice: 4d6` 4d6 cold damage each round to every creature in the area. This effect lasts 1 minute, during which time the nearest moon (probably Golarion's) appears an eerie blue color to any observers within 100 miles of the hearthstone. At the end of 1 minute, the hearthstone emits a blast of concentrated heat that deals `dice: 25d6` 25d6 fire damage to creatures and objects within 150 feet."
craft:
destruction: "Using _Aroden's Hearthstone_ to craft a cursed item results in a failed creation and causes the gemstone to split into five equal-sized but magically impotent pieces. Over the course of a year, four of theses pieces crumble to dust, while the fifth expands to the size of the original artifact and bears its powers anew. To destroy _Aroden's Hearthstone_, each of the separated pieces must be plunged into one of the five stars that compose the cosmic constellation known as the Follower."
