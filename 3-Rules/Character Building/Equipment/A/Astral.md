description: "Most magic weapons and armor gain their enhancements from potent eldritch runes etched into them. These runes allow for in-depth customization of items. Runes must be physically engraved on items through a special process to convey their effects. They take two forms: fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: potency runes add a bonus to either attack rolls or AC, striking runes add extra weapon damage dice, a resilient rune grants a bonus to saving throws. Property runes, by contrast, grant more varied effects—typically powers that are constant while the armor is worn or that take effect each time the inscribed item is used, such as a rune that grants energy resistance or one that adds fire damage to a weapon's attacks.<br><br>_Astral_ weapons command powerful spiritual energy from the Astral Plane. This rune has the same effects as a _[[Ghost Touch]]_ rune, plus Strikes with it deal an extra `dice: 1d6` 1d6 spirit damage. If used to attack a creature that's possessing another creature, this weapon deals no damage to the possessed creature. On a critical hit against a creature possessing another creature, the possessing creature must succeed at a DC 26 Will check save or be expelled and unable to possess a creature for `dice: 1d4` 1d4 rounds."
