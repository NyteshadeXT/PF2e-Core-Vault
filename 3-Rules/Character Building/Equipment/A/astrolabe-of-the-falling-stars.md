description: "This astrolabe is fashioned of magically attuned platinum plates and rings and is inset with carefully measured ruby gems. The astrolabe's back is engraved with helpful charts, a calendar, and a maker's mark. An _astrolabe of falling stars_ can be used as a [[Equipment/Mariner's Astrolabe|Mariner's Astrolabe]]. In addition, it can produce the following magical effect.  **Activate** `pf2:2` (Interact)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** With a flick of your finger, you set the astrolabe's rule spinning, causing the inset rubies to become a blur. Choose a point within 100 feet. The astrolabe of falling stars calls down a brief rain of meteorites in a 10-foot burst centered on that point, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning and 1d8 fire damage to creatures in the area (DC 19 Reflex check)."
