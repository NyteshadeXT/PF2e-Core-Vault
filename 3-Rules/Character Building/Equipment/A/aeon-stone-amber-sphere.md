description: "Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.  When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.  There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_."

mechanics: "If you are undead, your body regains much of the appearance it had in life, and you gain a +2 item bonus to Deception to [[Impersonate]]] yourself as a living creature. If you're alive, your appearance is the healthiest version of yourself, and you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Make an Impression]] or [[Request]] that involves your strength or vigor.  "

mechanics2: "The resonant power of the _amber sphere_ grants you a special activation to improve your salubrious appearance to a lurid extreme.  The stone casts a 7th-rank [[Mask of Terror]] on you (DC 34 Will check), causing your appearance to burst with a profusion of shocking vigor: your mouth fills with large and bright teeth, your hair animates in grasping tresses, your face flushes with bright blood that seeps from your skin, or similar. The image is unique to each observer, but you remain recognizably yourself regardless of the illusion's form."
