description: "Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.  When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.  There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_.  "

mechanics: "This four-sided prism is imbued with knowledge for the construction of several objects. The stone contains the knowledge of all formulas found in a basic crafter's book. While you have the stone invested, you have the full knowledge of the stone's formulas. This counts as having the formula for the purposes of Crafting checks. While you have this knowledge, you can write the formulas down for later use, such as if you lose access to the stone. You also gain a +1 item bonus to skill checks made to Craft while the stone is invested.  "
