description: "This brightly colored _+4 major resilient leather armor_ is inscribed with a spiral that has no end or beginning. Though it is a symbol of the ancient religion of Holy Xatramba, it also serves as a religious symbol of Pharasma. When you invest the armor, you gain void resistance 25 and can draw on the power of your ancestors. You gain an ancestry feat from your ancestry; the feat can be any level, but you must meet any other prerequisites of the feat. You lose the feat when the investment ends, and you can select a different feat each time you invest the armor again.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You use an ancestry feat that has a limited number of uses per day  * * *  **Effect** You gain an additional use of the ancestry feat. If you do not use it before the next time you make your daily preparations, the use is lost.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You begin casting a legend lore ritual to learn legends about your ancestry or about someone of your ancestry  * * *  **Effect** _Ancestral Embrace_ reduces the casting time of this ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The armor casts [[Spells/Avatar|Avatar]], granting these specific additional abilities instead of those associated with a deity: Speed 70 feet, air walk, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain  *   **Melee** `pf2:1` spear (reach 15 feet, thrown 50 feet), Damage 6d6+6 piercing *   **Ranged** `pf2:1` blowgun (range 120 feet), Damage 1d6+3 piercing plus 5d6 poison.  * * *  **Destruction** _Ancestral Embrace_ crumbles if its wearer intentionally and knowingly kills or desecrates the remains of six generations of their family."
