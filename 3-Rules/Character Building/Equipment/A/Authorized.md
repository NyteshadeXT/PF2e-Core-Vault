description: "Most magic weapons and armor gain their enhancements from potent eldritch runes etched into them. These runes allow for in-depth customization of items. Runes must be physically engraved on items through a special process to convey their effects. They take two forms: fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: potency runes add a bonus to either attack rolls or AC, striking runes add extra weapon damage dice, a resilient rune grants a bonus to saving throws. Property runes, by contrast, grant more varied effects—typically powers that are constant while the armor is worn or that take effect each time the inscribed item is used, such as a rune that grants energy resistance or one that adds fire damage to a weapon's attacks.<br><br>Sharp needles impale anyone who attempts to wield this weapon other than its rightful owner. Each authorized rune is etched with the blood of a specific creature. If any other creature wields the weapon, needles immediately erupt from the weapon's hilt or shaft, dealing `dice: 1d6` 1d8 piercing damage plus `dice: 1d4` 1d4 [[Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] to the wielder. If the weapon has a [[striking]] rune, this damage increases to `dice: 1d8` 1d8 piercing damage per damage die and `dice: 1d4` 1d4 [[Persistent Damage|persistent damage]] per damage die; this counts only the weapon's base die and dice from the striking rune. The [[Persistent Damage|persistent bleed damage]] can't end while the creature still holds the weapon. The spikes retract once the creature lets go.  When the rune is crafted, the crafter can choose to broaden the criteria for who can safely wield the item, expanding the users to creatures with a particular alignment, bloodline, or patron deity, as the crafter chooses. This criterion must be shared by the creature who contributed the blood for the rune."
