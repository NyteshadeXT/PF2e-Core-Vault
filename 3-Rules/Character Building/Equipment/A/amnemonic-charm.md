description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]], [[Actions/Lie|Lie]], [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], or [[Actions/Request|Request]]  **Requirements** You're a master in the skill you failed with.  * * *  This ornate locket, usually containing a faceless, humanoid portrait, is typically worn on a chain around the neck or attached to your clothing. When activated, the charm casts a [[Spells/Rewrite Memory|Rewrite Memory]] spell (DC 26 Will check) against a single target of the check, removing all memory of your failed attempt and potentially allowing you to make another attempt. The effect can't remove more than 3 minutes of memories from its target."
