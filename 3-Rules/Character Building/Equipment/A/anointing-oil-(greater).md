description: "Carried by many Knights of Lastwall, this amber-colored, fragrant-smelling oil is meant to prevent those who fall in battle from rising as undead. Applying _anointing oil_ to a corpse casts a 5th-rank [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on it. The effects last for 24 hours. The funerary rites of the Knights of Lastwall sometimes include using this type of oil on their dead if they are to be buried.  The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off."
