description: "You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Sterling artisan's tools give you a +1 item bonus to the check.  Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, a blacksmith's toolkit differs from a woodworker's toolkit. If you wear your artisan's toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it."
