description: "This luxurious cloak embodies an angel's swiftness. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] checks and never take falling damage, as your cloak billows like a pair of wings to soften any fall you take. When you invest in the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. If you are unholy, you are [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] while wearing this cloak."
