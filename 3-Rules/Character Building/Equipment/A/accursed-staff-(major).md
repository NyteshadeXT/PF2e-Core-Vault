description: "Iron strips line the body of an _accursed staff_, capping the bottom and folding into an intricate knot at the top. While wielding an _accursed staff_, you're empowered by the curses you inflict. If an enemy fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that has the curse trait, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell's rank. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes. The enemy must be a significant threat and can't have been a willing subject of the curse."
