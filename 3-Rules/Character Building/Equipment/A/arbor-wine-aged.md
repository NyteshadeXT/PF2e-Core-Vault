mechanics1: "For 1 minute after drinking a glass of assassin vine wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet. Assassin vine wine that has been aged for several years—or artificially aged with alchemy—develops both a greater complexity of flavor and a stronger connection to an assassin vine's bond with nature. When you drink the wine, vegetation in a 20-foot emanation around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn."
