description: "An admirer's bouquet appears to be a colorful silken handkerchief that exudes a pleasant floral scent until it's picked up, at which point a dozen vibrantly colored long- stemmed flowers appear in the carrier's hand, the stems wrapped in the silk.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** By taking a deep sniff of the pleasant-smelling flowers, you can speed your recovery from nausea and reduce your [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] value by 1.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** an ally with a free hand ends their turn adjacent to you  * * *  **Effect** You hand the admirer's bouquet to the triggering ally. If they accept the bouquet, they gain a +1 item bonus to saves against emotion and mental effects as long as they continue to carry the admirer's bouquet. If they're currently suffering from a debilitating emotion or mental effect as the result of a saving throw made during the previous turn, they can immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect upon being given the bouquet; if they do so, they gain the admirer's bouquet's +1 item bonus to this saving throw. An admirer's bouquet can allow for a new saving throw in this way only once per day."
