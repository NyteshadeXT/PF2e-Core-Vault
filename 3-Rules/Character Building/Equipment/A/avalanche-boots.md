description: "While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Force Open]] and [[Shove]]. When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever is higher."
