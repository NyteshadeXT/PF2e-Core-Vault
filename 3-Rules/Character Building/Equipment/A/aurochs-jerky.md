description: "**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  * * *  Aurochs meat already makes for tough jerky, but with the right alchemical treatment, it becomes legendarily resilient and imparts that durability to those who eat it. Eating the jerky causes a pair of inch-long horns to grow from your forehead (or causes your existing horns to grow noticeably) for 1 hour. During this time, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves. You can end the effect prematurely, causing the horns to retract or revert to their normal size, with a free action that has the concentrate trait.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Aurochs Jerky|Effect: Aurochs Jerky]]  * * *  **Aurochs' Endurance** `pf2:0` (concentrate)  **Trigger** You begin your turn and are [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]]  **Effect** You suppress the fatigued condition for 10 minutes. During this time, you are not immune to fatigue and can become fatigued by subsequent effects, but you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against effects that would fatigue you.
