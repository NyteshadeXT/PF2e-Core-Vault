description: "Aurochs meat already makes for tough jerky, but with the right alchemical treatment, it becomes legendarily resilient and imparts that durability to those who eat it. Eating the jerky causes a pair of inch-long horns to grow from your forehead (or causes your existing horns to grow noticeably) for 1 hour. During this time, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves. You can end the effect prematurely, causing the horns to retract or revert to their normal size, with a free action that has the concentrate trait."
