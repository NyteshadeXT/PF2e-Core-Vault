description: "This slim _+3 major striking unholy wounding dagger_ has a curved blade akin to that of a peeling knife. Soft elf-leather strips adorn the handle. If you are a demon, it amplifies any auras you have by granting a +1 item bonus to your aura's DCs.  **Activateâ€”Burrowing Splinter** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Frequency** one per day  **Requirements** Your previous action was a successful Strike with the _apotheosis knife_  * * *  **Effect** You twist the blade, causing a sliver of the dagger to break off inside the body of the creature you damaged with the _apotheosis knife_ on your prior action. Just as the blade itself cuts away flesh, this splinter slices away at the target's mind. The target must attempt a DC 43 Will check save. If the target is a demon, the burrowing splinter automatically triggers the effects of their sin vulnerability, regardless of their saving throw result.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target takes no additional damage.  **Success** The target takes 6d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of their next turn.  **Failure** The target takes 6d6 persistent mental damage and is stupefied 1 with an unlimited duration.  **Critical Failure** The target takes 12d6 persistent mental damage, is stupefied 1 with an unlimited duration, and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]]."
