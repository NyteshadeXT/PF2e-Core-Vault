description: "Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.  When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.  There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_.<br><br>While this aeon stone orbits your head, the flat part of its base tumbles to briefly face creatures you can see within 30 feet, as though the stone is watching them. You can activate this stone in two ways."
