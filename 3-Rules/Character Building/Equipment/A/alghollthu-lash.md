description: "This fleshy _+1 striking whip_ is obviously crafted from the tentacle of some fearsome beast, likely an alghollthu, and constantly drips slime.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The next creature you successfully Strike with this weapon is exposed to alghollthu slime.  **Alghollthu Slime** (curse, occult)  **Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude check  **Stage 1** no ill effect (1 round)  **Stage 2** the victim's skin softens, making the creature [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (1 round)  **Stage 3** the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, making it [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature's drained condition increases by 1 (permanent). A remove disease spell can counteract this curse, but immunity to disease offers no protection against it.  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a tentacle from an alghollthu."
