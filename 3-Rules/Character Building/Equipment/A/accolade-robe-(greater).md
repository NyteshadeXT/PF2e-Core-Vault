description: "Although not all wizards have gone through formal training, it's become tradition to enchant robes representing the arduous training required and festoon them with honors one has earned. Typically, an _accolade robe_ is styled after a single wizard school, with appropriate colors and symbols. Wearing these robes grants a +3 item bonus to Arcana checks.  The pockets of the robe tie to an extradimensional space that can hold 1 Bulk of items, none of which can have greater than light Bulk. The items must be related to spellcasting and academicsâ€”spellbooks, scrolls, wands, scholarly journals, and other academic supplies the GM allows. These items do not count against your Bulk limit. You can Interact to retrieve or stow items normally."
