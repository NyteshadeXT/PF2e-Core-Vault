description: "The four different types of _scroll cases of simplicity_ often bear adornments appropriate to their magical tradition, such as angelic wings or otherworldly lettering. On the inside, intricate runic diagrams spiral out to surround the scroll stored within. A scroll placed within the case can be converted into energy to cast consistently useful spells depending on its type. You must be able to cast spells of a given tradition to use a _scroll case of simplicity_ of a corresponding type."

If you use any action other than to Cast a Spell from the scroll case after activating the _scroll case of simplicity_, the scroll and its energy are lost.  The scroll case can be used to cast [[Alarm]] or [[Phantasmal Minion]]"
