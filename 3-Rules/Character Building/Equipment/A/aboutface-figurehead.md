description: "This otherwise plain-looking figurehead has the concerned expression of someone afraid they're being chased. If the vessel the figurehead is attached to has the sluggish vehicle ability, the figurehead suppresses that ability. Captains frequently give the ability to activate an aboutface figurehead to the person at the helm of their ship."
