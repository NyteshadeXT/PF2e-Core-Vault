description: "The artistic echo of the Ekujae hero Iyalirrin animates the _Anima Robe's_ stitching to display embroidered reactions to situations experienced by the wearer. The _Anima Robe's_ telepathic voice is filled with confidence (almost to the point of cockiness) and is supportive, often encouraging his partner to take risky or showy actions yet never to the extent that would put them in significant harm's way.  The _Anima Robe_ grants a +3 item bonus to Diplomacy checks made to [[Make an Impression]] and to all [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] checks, and you gain resistance 15 to mental damage."
