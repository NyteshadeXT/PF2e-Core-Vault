description: "**Perception** +33; precise low-light vision and hearing within 30 feet  **Communication** telepathy (partner only)  **Skills** Deception +35, Occultism +34, Performance +35  **Int** +6, **Wis** +5, **Cha** +7  **Will** +33  * * *  The artistic echo of the Ekujae hero Iyalirrin animates the _Anima Robe's_ stitching to display embroidered reactions to situations experienced by the wearer. The _Anima Robe's_ telepathic voice is filled with confidence (almost to the point of cockiness) and is supportive, often encouraging his partner to take risky or showy actions yet never to the extent that would put them in significant harm's way.  The _Anima Robe_ grants a +3 item bonus to Diplomacy checks made to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] and to all Performance checks, and you gain resistance 15 to mental damage.  * * *  **Activate–Billowing Distraction** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Effect** The _Anima Robe_ billows as if in a blustery wind and attempts to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] a creature you're adjacent to.  * * *  **Activate–Who Am I?** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Effect** The robe's hood rises up over your head, casting a 4th-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] to your specifications.  * * *  **Activate–Who Are We?** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** The robe's hem swishes, casting a 7th-rank _illusory disguise_ to your specifications.  * * *  **Activate—Who Are They?** `pf2:2` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** An image of a creature shows up in the robe's stitching, then appears to come to life; the robe casts an 8th-rank [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]] to your specifications. The robe can use an action to Sustain this activation for up to 1 minute."
