description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  This gummy liquid disproportionately lengthens your legs, causing you to grow but making your movement awkward. The effect is very noticeable unless your clothes can adequately conceal it.  **Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and you gain a +15 foot status bonus to your Speed. In addition, you grow one size larger, but your larger size does not have any additional effects beyond the potential change in space.  **Drawback** You take a -1 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty to Reflex saves.  **Duration** 10 minutes.
