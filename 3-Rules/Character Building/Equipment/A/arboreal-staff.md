description: "Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly [[3-Rules/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Arboreal Warden|Arboreal Wardens]] undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a [[verdant-staff-(greater)|Verdant Staff (Greater)]], though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an arboreal staff is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.  In addition to the activation and spells of a [[verdant-staff-(greater)|Verdant Staff (Greater)]], an arboreal staff can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff's wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has [[Earthbind]] available as a 3rd-rank spell.  "
