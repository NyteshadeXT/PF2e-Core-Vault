description: "**Ammunition** round  **Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential.  The shot is a high-grade adamantine bullet. The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a construct or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of awakened metal shot is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book."
