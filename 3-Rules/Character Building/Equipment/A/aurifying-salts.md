description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  You can apply this pale eggshell powder to one outfit, one object of up to Medium size, or up to 10 smaller objects in the same space, such as jewelry, to make them appear gilded for 1 hour. If used as part of Making an Impression on an audience swayed by expensive clothing, it makes most clothing or jewelry seem to be worth 10 times as much as they really are. Only someone who closely inspects an affected item notices it's not real gold. If you apply the salts to an object made of metal, the metal softens like gold, reducing its Hardness by 4 (to a minimum of Hardness 10) for 1 hour."
