description: "This robe was the favored garment of the legendary Ekujae hero, Iyalirrin. When the draconic god Dahak threatened destruction, Iyalirrin was the primary architect of a powerful ritual to banish him called the anima invocation. Iyalirrin and many others were forced to sacrifice themselves to empower this ritual, but he ensured his _Anima Robe_ remained in good hands before he did so. Since then, the _Anima Robe_ has been worn by dozens of elven occultists and bards who have traveled Golarion and beyond. The _Anima Robe_ has remained in the care of Queen Telandia for only the past few dozen years.  While wearing the _Anima Robe_, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks made to [[Make an Impression]] and to all [[Skills#Performance|Performance]] checks. You also gain resistance 10 to mental damage."
