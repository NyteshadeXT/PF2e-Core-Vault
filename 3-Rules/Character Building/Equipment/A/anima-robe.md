description: "This robe was the favored garment of the legendary Ekujae hero, Iyalirrin. When the draconic god Dahak threatened destruction, Iyalirrin was the primary architect of a powerful ritual to banish him called the anima invocation. Iyalirrin and many others were forced to sacrifice themselves to empower this ritual, but he ensured his _Anima Robe_ remained in good hands before he did so. Since then, the _Anima Robe_ has been worn by dozens of elven occultists and bards who have traveled Golarion and beyond. The _Anima Robe_ has remained in the care of Queen Telandia for only the past few dozen years.  While wearing the _Anima Robe_, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks made to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] and to all Performance checks. You also gain resistance 10 to mental damage.  * * *  **Activate—Who Am I?** `pf2:1` (concentrate, illusion, manipulate, visual) With a toss of the robe's hood, you cast a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] on yourself.  * * *  **Activate—Who Are We?** `pf2:1` (concentrate, illusion, manipulate, visual)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** With a whirl of the robe's hem, you cast a 7th-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]].  * * *  **Activate—Who Are They?** `pf2:1` (auditory, concentrate, illusion, manipulate, olfactory, visual)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** With a swish of the robe's sleeve, you cast a 7th-rank [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]]."
