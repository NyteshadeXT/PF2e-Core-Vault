description: "The first time each day you die, your vital and spiritual essences mingle together and reside within this aeon stone.  You have a limited sense of how many life forces are currently within 30 feet of the stone, which you can potentially use to determine when it's safe to call on the stone's power. At any time within the next hour after your body died, you can spend 1 minute concentrating in order to return to your body.  As long as your body is still intact, you are no longer dead- you are restored to 1 HP with the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 3]] and [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 3]] conditions. You can benefit from the effects of only one pale orange rhomboid aeon stone in a given day.  The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the aeon stone; as long as the wayfinder remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point."
