description: "Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.  When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.  There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_."

mechanics1: "When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone's effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another _pink rhomboid aeon stone_, before then."
