description: "This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] to other planes.  When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-rank [[Spells/Planar Tether|Planar Tether]] on the target (DC 38 Will, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the _dimensional anchor_ lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-rank _dimensional anchor_ for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28)."
