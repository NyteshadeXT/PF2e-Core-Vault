description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated _antler arrow_ hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex check save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow.  If the hit with the _antler arrow_ is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15."
