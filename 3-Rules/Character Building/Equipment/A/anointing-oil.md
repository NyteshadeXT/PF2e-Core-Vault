description: "Carried by many Knights of Lastwall, this amber-colored, fragrant-smelling oil is meant to prevent those who fall in battle from rising as undead. Applying _anointing oil_ to a corpse casts [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on it. The effects last for 24 hours.  The oil is repugnant to the undead. An undead creature that touches a corpse treated with this oil is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the contact is broken or the oil's effect wears off."
