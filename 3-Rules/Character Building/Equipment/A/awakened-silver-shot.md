description: "**Ammunition** round  **Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential.  The shot is a high-grade silver bullet. The awakened silver gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken and expose devils and werecreatures. On a hit, it attempts to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The counteract rank is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the Change Shape ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a polymorph effect, the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute instead."
