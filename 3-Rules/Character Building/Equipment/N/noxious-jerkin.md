When worn, it infuses your body with a ghastly and nauseating flavor.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You are grabbed or are hit by an unarmed attack  * * *  **Effect** Your attacker must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude check saving throw. Creatures with a stench aura, such as otyughs and xulgaths, are immune to this effect.  **Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the noxious jerkin for 1 minute.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].  **Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 1 and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round."
