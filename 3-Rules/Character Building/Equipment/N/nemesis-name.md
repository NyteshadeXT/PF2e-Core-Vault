description: "You want revenge badly enough that you tattoo your nemesis's name in a place you can easily see to remember your vow to settle the score. Anyone who sees the tattoo senses your hatred of the named being. Receiving a new nemesis name makes any you already have non-magical.  You gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against the creature named on your tattoo, but this nemesis gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls against you.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command (mental)  **Frequency** once per round  **Requirements** You can see your nemesis, and they're within 30 feet of you  * * *  **Effect** You focus your hatred into a mental scream. Your nemesis takes 3d6 mental, which they can resist with a DC 26 Will check save. You take half as much damage as your nemesis does, and you can't reduce this damage in any way."
