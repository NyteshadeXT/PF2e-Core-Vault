description: "The intricate beading of this shawl subtly guides you. While you wear the shawl, you always know which direction is north and gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks.  **Activateâ€”Mind's Map** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  You focus your mind's eye on a location you've been to previously. The beads on the shawl shift colors to create a map of the area based on your memories. You can dismiss this effect as a free action."
