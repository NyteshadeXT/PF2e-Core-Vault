description: "This macabre staff is crafted from gleaming white bone, a spinal column spiraling out of its base with a skull swinging from the spine's tip. It was handcrafted for Nyctessa by her father, a powerful Blood Lord, from her mortal mother's bones.  When you damage a creature with Nyctessa's staff, that creature gains weakness 2 to void damage until the end of your next turn.  [[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Sepulchral Drain|Effect: Sepulchral Drain]]  **Activate** Cast a Spell  * * *  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Void Warp|Void Warp]] *   **1st** [[Spells/Summon Undead|Summon Undead]], [[Spells/Fear|Fear]]"
