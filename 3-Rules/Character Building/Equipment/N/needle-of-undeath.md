description: "This thin, wand-like implement is carved from bone and scrimshawed with depictions of battle. While holding the _needle of undeath_, mindless undead creatures see you as one of their own and are indifferent to you until you take hostile actions against them, and you have a +2 item bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks against intelligent undead. This does not affect a summoned undead's attitude.  **Activateâ€”Speak with Undead** `pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per hour  * * *  **Effect** You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead or make simple requests of them with a +2 item bonus. You cannot make this request of someone else's summoned undead."
