description: "This _+1 striking frost katana_ is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of dragon-turtle ivory and wrapped in strips of winter wolf hide. Strikes with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are slowed. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` command (cold, evocation, magical)  **Frequency** once per 1 minute  **Trigger** Your spell deals cold damage to a creature  * * *  **Effect** Choose one creature dealt cold damage by the spell. It takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round."
