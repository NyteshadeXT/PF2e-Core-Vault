description: "This object, made of silver light, takes the form of a small musical instrument, prop, or other tool associated with a specific art form. The holder of the _immaculate instrument_ never suffers from creative blocks of any kind and their work is always insightful and skilled. A character who uses the _immaculate instrument_ to [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] or [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] can attempt the check at mythic proficiency once per month, and as long as they possess their _immaculate instrument_, they treat any critical failures with these skills as failures.  * * *  **Destruction** If the holder uses the _immaculate instrument_ to intentionally produce a work that is not just mediocre or crass, but one that devalues the public opinion of the art form itself in a showing of at least 100 spectators, the instrument fades away in shame."
