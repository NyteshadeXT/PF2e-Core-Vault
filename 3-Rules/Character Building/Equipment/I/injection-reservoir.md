description: "This reservoir and spring-loaded needle can be attached to a weapon to let it inject deadly poisons. Additionally, the reservoir can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the adjusted weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison by activating the reservoir with an Interact action. Refilling the reservoir with a new poison requires 3 Interact actions and uses both hands.  Adding an injection reservoir to a weapon throws off its balance, causing the multiple attack penalty with the weapon to be one greater than usual (usually –6 on a second attack and –11 on a third; or –5 and –10 with an agile weapon)."
