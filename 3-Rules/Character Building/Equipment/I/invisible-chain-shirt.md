description: "This _+2 resilient [[Equipment/Invisibility|Invisibility]] chain shirt_ is itself invisible. Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's invisible composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt. It loses the noisy trait and gains the comfort trait.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** You Stride and turn partially invisible, becoming [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] until the end of your next turn or until you use a hostile action, whichever comes first. As normal, you can use the concealment from this activation to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]]."
