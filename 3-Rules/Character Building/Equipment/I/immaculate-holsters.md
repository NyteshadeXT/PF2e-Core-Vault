description: "This pristine leather belt is made of treated and polished black leather with silver fittings; it features a pair of matching leather holsters that can each fit a one-handed firearm or hand crossbow.  **Activateâ€”Immaculatize** `pf2:3` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** Up to two firearms currently holstered in the immaculate holsters are instantly cleaned and oiled, protecting them from accidental misfires (though not misfires caused as a result of using a feat or ability). The holstered weapons are also reloaded with non-magical 0-level ammunition appropriate to a weapon of their type; if a firearm has multiple chambers, such as a slide pistol, each empty chamber is loaded. Immaculate holsters can't reload the cartridge of a repeating weapon."
