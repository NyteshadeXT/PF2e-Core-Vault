description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  You activate this folded lace handkerchief by spreading it out on the ground, where it grows to cover a 30-foot-by- 30-foot square area. Pale and diaphanous, the spread handkerchief is exceptionally difficult to see from more than 30 feet away and evaporates entirely after 1 minute. Any creature that falls on the net doesn't take falling damage."
