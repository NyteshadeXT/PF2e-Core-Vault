description: "An _instinct crown_ is a magical headpiece imbued with the essence of instincts that barbarians draw upon in combat. Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an animal instinct crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a _giant instinct crown_. When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct. You must be able to Rage to use the crown's activations.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Trigger** You roll initiative  * * *  **Effect** You Rage, gaining 10 additional temporary Hit Points.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Requirements** The crown's instinct matches your barbarian instinct  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You Rage and draw upon your instinct to gain a boon. Your bestial instincts take over, granting you greater ferocity. You can Stride as part of the activation, and you gain 10 additional temporary Hit Points. Until the end of your rage, you deal 3 additional with your animal's unarmed attacks, and those unarmed attacks gain the deadly d8 trait."
