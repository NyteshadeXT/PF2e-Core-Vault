description: "**Usage** affixed to headgear  **Activate** `pf2:0` Envision.  * * *  Via some strange alchemical reaction with the gasses of Terwa Lake, the cloud dragon Ixamè's eyeballs have shriveled into sky-blue gems. The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed. Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman.  _Ixamè's eye_ sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature concealed only by fog or mist is no longer concealed to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], this also means it's no longer hidden or undetected."
