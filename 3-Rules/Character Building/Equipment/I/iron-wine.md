description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Access** Tian Xia origin  * * *  This strong, clear liquor is made from fermented rice.  When you drink a cup of iron wine, your sweat becomes highly combustive for the next 10 minutes, igniting with the slightest bit of friction. This causes your unarmed attacks to deal an additional 1d4 fire damage for the duration of the effect.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Iron Wine|Effect: Iron Wine]]  Drinking more than one cup of iron wine in a single day gives you weakness 5 to fire until your next daily preparations.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Iron Wine Weakness|Effect: Iron Wine Weakness]]"
