description: "**Activate** 10 minutes (Interact)  * * *  This slender bar of pine-scented soap can only be activated when you're immersed in water. Upon activation, the soap covers you in a sudsy foam that quickly fades, filling you with energy and soothing away aches and pains. It immediately restores 10 healing Hit Points and removes the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition. If you begin an 8-hour period of rest immediately after using invigorating soap, you regain an additional 10 Hit Points from resting."
