description: "This [[Equipment/Net|Net]] was woven by the jorogumo Injigo, who presented it as a gift to her gnome sweetheart, Mara, to keep her safe in their mountain cottage when Injigo left on hunting expeditions. _Injigo's Loving Embrace_ functions as a typical net. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks made to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] with the net.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You spin the net in the direction of an incorporeal creature within 30 feet that you can see. Lines of silken force whip out to lash around the incorporeal creature, who must attempt a DC 25 Reflex check save to avoid becoming [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the end of your next turn. You can Sustain this activation for up to 1 minute, and the creature must succeed at a DC 25 check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] the net.  * * *  **Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact)  **Frequency** once per week  **Effect** You wrap the net around you like a blanket as you prepare to sleep. As long as you get 8 hours of sleep or analogous rest, you dream of writing love letters to someone you adore: this could be an actual paramour, someone you're interested in, or someone unknown whose identity you don't recall after waking. When you wake, you're filled with a sense of melancholia about those unsent letters, but these feelings distract you from other, more unpleasant thoughts, granting you resistance 5 to mental damage and a +1 item bonus to saving throws against mental effects for the next 8 hours.
