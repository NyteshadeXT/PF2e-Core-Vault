description: "The pages of this part-spellbook, part-bestiary are illustrated with all manner of creatures, magical and mundane. The illustrations shift and move around the page when examined.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision (spellshape)  **Effect** If your next action is to cast a conjuration spell prepared from this grimoire that summons one or more creatures, you summon creatures from the _illuminated folio_ rather than their usual source. These summoned creatures appear as living illustrations, granting them resistance to physical damage equal to half their level and weakness 5 to fire and to any ability with the water trait. They can also fold themselves up to pass through spaces only an inch or so wide as part of their movement.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Illuminated Folio|Effect: Illuminated Folio]]"
