description: "This ornate codex is bound in woven strands of magical filament and monster sinew, depicting shifting illustrations that pulse and evolve as you study them. The book's pages whisper with possibility and sometimes display multiple mirrored outcomes of a single experiment. While invested in the Codex of the Eidolonic Tapestry, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>- When you succeed or critically succeed at a Formula Discovery check, you glimpse two possible crafting outcomes tied to the same creature. You may select one of the two revealed formulas to inscribe into the Codex. The alternate formula becomes inaccessible unless re-discovered.<br>- If used during experimentation with volatile or unstable parts, the Codex reduces the chance of backlashâ€”you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves or checks against critical failure backlash effects.<br><br>If damaged by volatile backlash, the Codex can be repaired with a [[Skills#Crafting|Crafting]] check (DC 25).<br><br>Only one Codex of the Eidolonic Tapestry is known to exist. Its ownership is highly contested among arcane scholars, chimera alchemists, and extraplanar collectors."
