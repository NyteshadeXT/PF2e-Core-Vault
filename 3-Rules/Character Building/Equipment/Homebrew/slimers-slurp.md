description: "A radiant green liquid fills this common glass vial.  When observed, the liquid itslef seems to be in a constant state of clawing motion as it tries to seep out of any small space between the vial and the harty stopper that has been used to plug the top.  The smell of it is strangely sweet with a hit of citrus that hangs in the nostrils.  The taste when consumed is slightly bitter, but overwhelmingly saccharine, leaving a hanging sour taste afterwards.<br><br>When you consume this potion, for the next 10 minutes your flesh, bones, and muscles become jelly-like and holding your normal form becomes difficult.  You take a -5 foot penalty to your base movement speed.  During this time, your body becomes extremely viscous and deformable allowing you to attempt to Squeeze through any gap that is no smaller than 1 inch. Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to your [[Skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check when you attempt to Squeeze."
