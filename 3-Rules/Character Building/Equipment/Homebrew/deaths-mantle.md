description: "This flowing black cloak is cold to the touch and glimmers faintly with spectral motes that resemble drifting ashes. When you don the mantle, you sometimes glimpse faint, skeletal hands brushing the inside of the hood. A whisper of your own death seems to linger just behind your breath. Scholars whisper that each Death’s Mantle remembers its former bearer and grows darker with every life its wearer terrifies."

mechanics1: "You draw the Mantle’s shadow tight around you and transform into a ghastly, spectral vision for 1 minute. Your features blur into an ashen mask, and faint echoes of tolling bells follow your movements. Those who see the Mantle activated describe the wearer as a hollow phantom surrounded by drifting cinders; shadows stretch toward the cloak as though seeking refuge within it. When you activate this ability, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet who can see you. Each target must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n**Success** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n **Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 3]] and becomes [[Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] as its body withers briefly under the Mantle’s necrotic illusion.  This clumsiness lasts for 1 minute.\n\nA creature that succeeds on its save becomes immune to your Visage of Terror for 24 hours.\n\nWhile the effect lasts, you appear spectral—your body slightly translucent, your voice echoing. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks to [[Demoralize]], and your footsteps make no sound."
