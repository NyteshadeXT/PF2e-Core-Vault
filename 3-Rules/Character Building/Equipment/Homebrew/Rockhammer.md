## Description
Little more than chunks of pig-iron affixed to splintering hafts, rockhammers serve miners in breaking apart and molding dense rocks and metals. When put to use on more mobile targets, these massive hammers prove incredibly awkward yet provide passingly destructive effects to warrant their occasional use as weapons.

## Special Properties
- **Awkward Construction**: When used as a weapon, the rockhammer imposes a **-2 penalty on attack rolls**.  
- **Shove**: The rockhammer is designed to transfer force, allowing you to use it to push enemies backward during Athletics checks.
