description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by goblin alchemists working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a Strike using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like [[Actions/Grapple|Grappling]] or [[Actions/Trip|Tripping]] you using its jaws or Swallowing you Whole. Creatures, especially animals, often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] as a reaction.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Pucker Pickle|Effect: Pucker Pickle]]"
