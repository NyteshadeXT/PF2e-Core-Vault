description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to detection effects.  This grants the same effects as [[Spells/Hidden Mind|Hidden Mind]] but without the bonus against mental effects. You also gain the effects of a 4th-rank [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] spell, which protects against [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] spells of 8th rank and lower and has a DC of 36 against [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]].  The potion's effects last for 10 minutes."
