description: "You set several barbed animal spines or wooden stakes in the ground, each tipped with poison from a venomous animal or toxic plant. The snare deals 1d4 piercing damage to the first creature to enter its square (DC 15 Reflex check). On a failed save, several barbs lodge in the creature's feet. For 1 minute (or until a creature or an ally spends three Interact actions to remove the barbs), the barbs deal 1d4 poison damage to the creature each time it Strides more than half its Speed."
