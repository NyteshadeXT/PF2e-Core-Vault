description: "These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can't be soiled or blemished. While wearing _perfected robes_, you don't need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]] (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]], and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] while wearing them, gaining the true seeing but otherwise unable to use the robes' magic.  **Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** If your next action is to attempt a d20 roll with which you have legendary proficiency, roll twice and take the better result. This is a fortune effect.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You cast [[Spells/Avatar|Avatar]], gaining the abilities for Irori.  **Destruction** If the wearer ever willingly turns from the path of self-perfection into corruption or overindulgence, their _perfected robes_ crumble to nothing."
