description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike  * * *  This flask contains fast-growing mold spores, which quickly take root but just as quickly rot away. You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 4 poison damage, 4d4 persistent piercing damage, and 4 poison splash damage. Except on a critical failure, the bomb's splash area is coated in vegetation, becoming difficult terrain for 1 minute."
