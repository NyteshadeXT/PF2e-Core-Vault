description: "**Devil** [[Bestiary 1/Barbazu|Barbazu]]  **Decipher Writing** Society, Warfare Lore  * * *  You negotiate for might and viciousness.  **Benefit** Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 bleed damage. On a critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to half your level.  **Payment** You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the Medicine skill.  **Hidden Condition** The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.  **Termination Clause** The contract guarantees that you will not "be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action." This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from persistent bleed damage from any source, the contract is voided."
