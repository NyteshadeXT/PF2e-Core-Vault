description: "This sinister suit of jet-black _+1 resilient full plate_ was designed to bolster the graveknights of Yled's undead armies, creating unstoppable legions.  The armor gains additional abilities if it is a graveknight's armor. If a graveknight wearing undamaged plate of Yled is destroyed, the armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 rounds instead of 1d10 days. A living creature who dons the armor is affected by the graveknight's curse immediately instead of 1 hour.  **Activate** `pf2:1` envision  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** Your previous action was a weapon Strike that reduced a living creature to 0 HP  * * *  **Effect** The creature is targeted with [[Spells/Death Knell|Death Knell]] (DC 24).  * * *  **Craft Requirements** The metals used to create this armor must include a fragment from a previous graveknight's armor."
