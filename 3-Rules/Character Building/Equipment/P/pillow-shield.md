description: "The shield's blue enameled face is cool to the touch, and displays the moon's current phase at night. When you lay your head on the reverse side of this steel shield, it becomes as pliant and supportive as the best pillows. If you complete a period of rest using the pillow shield, you can choose to transfer your recovery to the shield. Instead of recovering a number of Hit Points after resting, the shield is restored an equal number of Hit Points instead.      | Hardness | HP | BT | | --- | --- | --- | | 6 | 36 | 18 |  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The shield creates an area of vigilance. It casts [[Spells/Alarm|Alarm]] centered on itself; you decide whether it creates a mental alarm or an audible alarm. The alarm goes off at the end of the spell's duration or when triggered as normal, whichever comes first."
