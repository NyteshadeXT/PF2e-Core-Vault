description: "This ornate pipe is chiseled from a single bloodstone piece with wooden accents. When in use, the pipe gives off a vibrant red smoke that floats lazily in the air. These pipes are popular among bards and braggarts who like the ostentatious smoke it gives offâ€”and who often use it to create raucous diversions or send indiscreet signals.  **Activate** `pf2:2` Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The smoke forms a bird that flies up to 120 feet in a direction of your choice. When it collides with a solid object or travels the full range, whichever is shorter, it explodes in a 20-foot burst of smoke with the effects of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]]."
