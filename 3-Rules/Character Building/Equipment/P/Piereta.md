description: "**Perception** +27; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet  **Communication** telepathy (Azlanti, Celestial, Common, Utopian)  **Skills** Diplomacy +33, Religion +29, Warfare Lore +27  **Int** +0, **Wis** +4, **Cha** +6  **Will** +31  * * *  Piereta was a Knight of Ozem during the Shining Crusade, sworn to the service of Aroden's herald, [[Deities/Arazni|Arazni]]. After Arazni perished at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant, Piereta became the first paladin to swear her service to the newly ascended goddess, Iomedae. When she fell in battle, a fragment of her spirit clung to the sword through which she had wielded her faith in countless battles, granting the weapon a sentience of its own. The sword named herself after her fallen bearer and has been a faithful companion to many Iomedaean warriors since.  _Piereta_ is a _+3 major striking [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] rapier_ devoted to the principles of [[Deities/Iomedae|Iomedae]] as an exemplar of valorous action and as a protector of the innocent.  _Piereta_ is very particular about who she permits to wield her. She agrees to work with you if you are a follower of Iomedae, or if you are lawful good or neutral good and worship a different good deity. Otherwise, you must convince _Piereta_ of the rightness of your cause. If _Piereta_ doesn't want you to wield her, once per minute she can attempt to force you to put her down (DC 42 Will check to resist this command). Even if you succeed at this saving throw, _Piereta_ refuses to apply any of her fundamental or property runes and gives you a -2 penalty on attack rolls with _Piereta_ or any other weapon until you drop her.  _Piereta_ can use the following activations.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per minute  **Effect** _Piereta_ makes a [[Actions/Retributive Strike|Retributive Strike]], resolved as though you had used the ability, including any benefits from champion feats you have.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** _Piereta_ casts a 9th-rank [[Spells/Field of Life|Field of Life]]."
