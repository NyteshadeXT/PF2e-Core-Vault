description: "**Perception** +30; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet  **Communication** speech (Common and two other languages, usually regional and ancestral)  **Skills** Society +31, Thievery +31, Underworld Lore +31  **Int** +5, **Wis** +5, **Cha** +5  **Will** +30  * * *  Each purloining cloak is a mercurial mantle once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision  **Effect** The cloak casts 2nd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Effect** The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see. This valuation doesn't include the value of features the cloak can't discern, such as magical properties.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:r` Interact  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** An enemy misses you with a melee Strike  * * *  **Effect** You slip around the attacking creature with ease. You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a DC 38 Perception check check before you roll.  **Failure** This creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the Strike.  **Critical Failure** This creature is off-guard against all your attacks until the end of their next turn.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision (conjuration, teleportation)  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** The cloak hums with power as your whirl it around yourself, disappearing amid a brief flash of light. Teleport up to double your Speed to a location you can see. At the end of the teleportation, you can make a melee Strike against a creature within reach, if there is one."
