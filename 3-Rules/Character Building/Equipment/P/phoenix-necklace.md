description: "This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each phoenix necklace to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers hidden in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events. Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting [[Spells/Sending|Sending]], though the wearer can't respond.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:3` command, envision  **Effect** You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make nonlethal attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.  * * *  **Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact)  **Effect** The necklace consumes one of the attached silver feathers and casts 7th-rank [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]]. Activating this ability is particularly costly and every activation requires consuming one more silver feather than the previous activation.  * * *  **Destruction** Once a phoenix necklace has 10 silver feathers attached, Hao Jin can transform the necklace into a [[Equipment/Phoenix Fighting Fan|Phoenix Fighting Fan]], a process which requires 3 Interact actions."
