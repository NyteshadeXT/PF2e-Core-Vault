description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  **Access** Tian Xia origin  * * *  Though these preserved vegetables aren't actual moonflowers, they're made using a moonflower-distilled vinegar.  When consumed, tendrils sprout from your veins and curl around you, granting you a +2 status bonus to saves against void effects for 10 minutes and reducing your wounded condition by up to 2.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Preserved Moonflower|Effect: Preserved Moonflower]]  Eating more than one preserved moonflower dish in a day doesn't grant further benefits and makes you [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]."
