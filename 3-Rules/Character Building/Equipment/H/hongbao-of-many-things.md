description: "This enchanted long, red envelope is decorated with beautiful illustrations in gold ink. The hongbao holds twelve slips safely within.  **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact  * * *  **Effect** You draw a randomly selected slip from the hongbao, which transforms permanently into a useful item. Until you draw another item, the illustration on the outside of the hongbao changes to one of twelve animals, matching the item pulled. Each slip can be drawn only once; after the last slip is gone, the hongbao becomes a non-magical red envelope that retains the illustration of the final slip drawn. The effects of each slip are as follows:  1.  3d4 small firecracker pellets that let out a loud squeak when thrown against a hard surface. 2.  Embroidered [[Equipment/Leather Armor|Leather Armor]] made from oxhide. 3.  A [[Equipment/Healing Potion (Lesser)|Healing Potion (Lesser)]], except it is applied as a balm instead of drunk. 4.  A stuffed bunny dressed in red robes. 5.  50 feet of coiled silk [[Equipment/Rope|Rope]]. 6.  A bottle of snake wine. 7.  A wooden, horse-drawn [[Vehicles/Wagon|Wagon]]. 8.  A musical [[Equipment/Musical Instrument (Handheld)|Musical Instrument (Handheld)]] made out of a ram's horn. 9.  A collapsible metal-banded bo [[Equipment/Staff|Staff]]. 10.  An ornate jeweled egg. 11.  A small, jade, statuette of a guardian lion dog. 12.  6 delicious pork buns that function as emergency [[Equipment/Rations|Rations]]."
