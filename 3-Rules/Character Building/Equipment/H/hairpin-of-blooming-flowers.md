description: "The flower that adorns this hairpin is a blooming lotus flower that varies in color; it regrows in a day after the item is activated. Whether or not the hairpin's flower is in bloom, as long as you wear it and it's invested, it grants a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You pluck the flower from the hairpin and scatter the petals, creating a flurry of color in a 10-foot burst centered on you. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 minute or until you move from your current location. Any creature within the 10-foot burst when you Activate the Item must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex check save or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn (or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn on a critical failure). The flower blooms again the next day."
