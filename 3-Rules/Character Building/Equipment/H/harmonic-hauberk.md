description: "Rose gold and copper rings in this _+2 resilient chain shirt_ form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the auditory trait must first counteract the _harmonic hauberk_ or they have no effect on you.  The _harmonic hauberk_ attempts to counteract [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] spells cast on you and 4th-rank or higher heightened _silence_ spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract rank 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a _silence_ spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Frequency** once per day  **Requirements** You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one composition spell  * * *  **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast [[Spells/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]], using your Performance check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the [[Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]]. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the [[Feats/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]] or [[Feats/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]] feats."
