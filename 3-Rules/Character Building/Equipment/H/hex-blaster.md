description: "This _+2 striking fearsome arquebus_ is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.  **Activate** `pf2:1` command  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of impending doom. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 Will check save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.  * * *  **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.  **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. It also takes 1d6 persistent mental damage.  **Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. It also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage.  **Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2 and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute. It also takes 4d6 persistent mental damage and is cursed with a hex of impending doom. If the target falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] from damage dealt by this Strike or the persistent mental damage, it remains unconscious for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still unconscious, it must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude check save or die; this effect has the death and incapacitation traits."
