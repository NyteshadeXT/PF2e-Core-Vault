description: "A _hell staff_ is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with Infernal inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections. Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where diabolic influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a _+3 greater striking axiomatic unholy staff_. When you prepare this staff, if you're holy, you become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations. The staff's _summon lesser servitor spell_ can be used only to summon animals with the fiend trait, devils, or hell hounds (at 4th level). Its _summon fiend_ spell can summon only devils or hell hounds.  * * *  **Activate** Cast a Spell  **Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.  *   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Divine Lance|Divine Lance]] (evil or lawful only) *   **1st** [[Spells/Protection|Protection]], [[Spells/Summon Lesser Servitor|Summon Lesser Servitor]] *   **2nd** [[Spells/Summon Lesser Servitor|Summon Lesser Servitor]], _Undetectable Alignment_ *   **3rd** [[Spells/Chilling Darkness|Chilling Darkness]], [[Spells/Summon Lesser Servitor|Summon Lesser Servitor]] *   **4th** [[Spells/Divine Wrath|Divine Wrath]] (evil or lawful only), [[Spells/Summon Lesser Servitor|Summon Lesser Servitor]] *   **5th** [[Spells/Flame Strike|Flame Strike]], [[Spells/Summon Fiend|Summon Fiend]] *   **6th** [[Spells/Devil Form|Devil Form]], [[Spells/Summon Fiend|Summon Fiend]] *   **7th** [[Spells/Divine Decree|Divine Decree]] (evil or lawful only), [[Spells/Summon Fiend|Summon Fiend]]  * * *  **Craft Requirements** You're lawful evil.
