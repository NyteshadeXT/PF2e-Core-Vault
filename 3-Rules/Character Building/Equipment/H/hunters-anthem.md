description: "This _+2 striking longbow_ is carefully handcrafted from a length of flexible green-tinted wood, etched in a variety of runic symbols, and strung with a dawnsilver bowstring. When you shoot the bow in rapid succession, the echoing chords generated by the bowstring form a haunting dirge that evokes the inevitable end of all things. If you have the [[Class Features/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] class feature, the weapon gains the _[[Equipment/Thundering|Thundering]]_ rune on Strikes against your prey.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Song of the Bow** `pf2:2` (concentration)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You shoot an arrow thrumming with the song of the bow. Make a Strike with the bow that deals damage as normal. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the arrow explodes in a 20-foot emanation around your target, dealing 5d10 sonic damage to creatures in the area, including the target, with a DC 28 Fortitude check. Any creature that critically fails is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute. If any creature in the area is [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] or [[Conditions/Unnoticed|Unnoticed]] by you, you learn its location, making it [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to you instead."
