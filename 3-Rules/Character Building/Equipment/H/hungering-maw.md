description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` command  **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a possession effect  **Requirements** You are a master in Will saves.  * * *  A shining onyx gemstone clutched in a pair of black steel jaws, this pendant is a potent defense against hostile spirits and other beings who commandeer the bodies of others. When you Activate it, you gain a +4 item bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. If your result prevents you from being possessed, the creature that attempted to possess you is subject to a DC 37 [[Spells/Seize Soul|Seize Soul]] spell, which can trap it in the talisman as if it had recently died. The talisman's magic is exhausted after use, but a soul trapped this way remains imprisoned inside, as detailed in the spell description. Starting at the end of its next turn, the trapped creature gets a new save to end the effect at the end of each of its turns."
