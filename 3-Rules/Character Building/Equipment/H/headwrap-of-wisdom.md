description: "This simple scarf is designed for wrapping around the head and comes with a gemmed pin for decoration. When you invest the headwrap, you either increase your Wisdom modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.  * * *  **Activate—Consider the Consequences** `pf2:1` (concentrate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it's a good idea. You gain the effects of an [[Spells/Augury|Augury]] spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.  * * *  **Activate—Reclaim Your Mind** `pf2:r` (concentrate, fortune)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]]  **Effect** The _headwrap of wisdom_ clears your mind. You can reroll the saving throw and use the better result."
