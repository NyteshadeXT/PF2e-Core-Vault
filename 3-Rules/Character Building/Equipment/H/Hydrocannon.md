description: "This _+1 striking hand cannon_ is crafted by wrapping the water-producing organ cluster of a grodair around its barrel, eliminating the need for ammunition, though the living tissue must be maintained with 1 sp of specialized nutrient feed each day. If not, its misfire check is DC 10 Flat check. If you fail this misfire check, the organ bursts, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice to you and rendering the _hydrocannon_ broken.  * * *  **Activate—Tinker Shot** `pf2:2` (manipulation)  **Frequency** once per minute  **Effect** You fiddle with the pressure regulator on the _hydrocannon_ and then make a ranged Strike with the gun. A successful attack has an additional effect depending on which modular configuration the _hydrocannon_ is currently in.  *   **Bludgeoning** The target is pushed 5 feet away from you; this forced movement is increased to 10 feet on a critical hit.      *   **Piercing** The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.      *   **Slashing** The target takes 1d6 bleed damage.       * * *  **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the extradimensional organ cluster extracted from a grodair. Harvesting the organs of a grodair in this way differs greatly from the normal method; it takes an hour and a successful DC 22 Arcana check check. On a critical failure, the organ cluster bursts and deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the harvester."
