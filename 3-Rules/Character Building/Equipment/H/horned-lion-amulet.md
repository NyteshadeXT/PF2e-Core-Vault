description: "**Activate** `pf2:0` envision  **Trigger** You take fire damage  * * *  This small figurine of a horned lion sitting at attention is the size of a coin and carved from simple stone. The figurine can be fastened to a suit of armor as a charm or adornment.  When you activate the amulet, the lion's eyes glow with flames, granting you fire resistance 10 against the triggering damage and a subsequent fire resistance 5 for 1 minute.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Horned Lion Amulet|Effect: Horned Lion Amulet]]  If the triggering damage was due to persistent fire damage, you immediately attempt a DC 10 Flat check to recover from the persistent damage. The DC remains at 10 until the persistent fire damage ends.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Horned Lion Amulet Recovery|Effect: Horned Lion Amulet Recovery]]"
