description: "The handles of this _+1 striking scythe_ are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of Urgathoa, you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every Strike, it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:0` command (divine, necromancy, void)  **Frequency** once per round  * * *  **Effect** You deal 1d10 void damage to yourself. If your next action is to Strike with the scythe or to Cast a Spell with the disease or void trait, that Strike or spell deals additional void damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses)."
