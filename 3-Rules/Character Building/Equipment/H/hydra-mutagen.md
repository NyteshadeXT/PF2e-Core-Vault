description: "**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)  * * *  You sprout a second head, increasing your awareness, intuition, and cognitive ability but also causing your physical capabilities to be impaired as both minds struggle to control a single body.  **Benefit** For 10 minutes, you gain all-around vision and a +3 item bonus to all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. Once during the mutagen's effect, if you fail or critically fail a Will saving throw against a mental effect, you can treat the result as one degree of success better.  **Drawback** You are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 10 minutes.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Hydra Mutagen|Effect: Hydra Mutagen]]"
