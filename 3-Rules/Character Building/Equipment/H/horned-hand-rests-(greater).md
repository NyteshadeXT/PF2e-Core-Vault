description: "These thick bull or ram horns fuse into the armrests of your legchair companion, giving it more aggressive options. Your animal companion can only invest this item if it is a legchair.  **Activate** `pf2:1` or `pf2:2` envision  **Frequency** once per minute  * * *  **Effect** You trace your finger along the base of the ram horns, with an effect depending on how many actions you spent.  `pf2:1` Your legchair draws force from its momentum. Until the end of this turn, if your legchair Strides, it deals 3d6 additional force damage on its next Strike and, on a critical success, pushes the target away by 10 feet.  `pf2:2` Your legchair fires a beam of force from its ram horns. The target takes 6d6 force damage and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude check save.  * * *  **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  **Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet.  **Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet.  **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed 20 feet."
