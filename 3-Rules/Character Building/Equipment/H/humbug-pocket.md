description: "Fine silk lines this fashionable pocket, which is typically cinched to a belt or tailored into a piece of formal clothing. The pocket can hold no more than one item of light Bulk, plus incidental items of negligible Bulk. The pocket grants you a +2 item bonus to Society and to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] in the pocket.  The pocket can produce stationery and writing implements of high quality. When you [[Actions/Create Forgery|Create a Forgery]], you can use the pocket to produce ideal materials to make the forgery. Any materials must be able to fit through the opening of the pocket, such as a roll of parchment, an inkwell, or a loupe. Though they're excellent tools, they don't have any value if sold and disappear once their function in making a forgery is fulfilled.  * * *  **Activateâ€”Papers Please** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** You create a temporary forgery by imagining the document you need and pulling it from the pocket. Attempt to Create a Forgery of the document you desire, with the GM rolling the secret check as normal. Its quality is based on your check, but the document disintegrates after 1 hour."
