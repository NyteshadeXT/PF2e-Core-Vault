description: "This pointy, brimmed hat made up of a rainbow patchwork of various materials seems to sit just a little lopsided on your head, no matter how you adjust it. You gain a +2 item bonus to checks to Earn Income.  * * *  **Activate** `pf2:3` envision, Interact  **Frequency** once per day  * * *  **Effect** You tear off a patch of cloth to manifest it into a copy of yourself, dressed in the color and fabric of the patch. The copy follows your specific instructions and performs a single, straightforward task for up to 30 minutes. It takes the copy three times as long to complete the task as it would you, meaning it can perform a task that would take you a maximum of 10 minutes. It doesn't react quickly enough to be of any use during an encounter, and it can't use your spells or other special abilities-just basic actions and skill actions.  The copy disappears and returns to the hat as a piece of cloth when the given task has been completed, or when you Dismiss the activation."
