description: "A _horn of exorcism_ is an instrument made from an animal horn, or an object of the same shape from carved wood or ivory.  * * *  **Activate—Rattle the Dead** `pf2:1` (auditory, manipulate)  **Frequency** once per hour  **Effect** Blowing into the horn frightens ghosts and evil spirits who can hear its call. Make an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] against all creatures with the undead or unholy trait in a 30-foot emanation. This can affect even a mindless creature with that trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.  * * *  **Activate—Sacred Seeds** `pf2:2` (manipulate)  **Frequency** once per day  **Effect** You fill the horn with sacred seeds and then scatter them around you with a twist of your wrist. The horn grants you and your allies in a 30-foot emanation the _ghost touch_ property rune on all of your weapon and unarmed Strikes for 1 minute.  [[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Horn of Exorcism (Sacred Seeds)|Effect: Horn of Exorcism (Sacred Seeds)]]"
