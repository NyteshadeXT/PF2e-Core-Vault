# Future Spell Learning
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Time Mage Dedication
* * *
More future memories of time magic percolate back to the present, teaching you spells you've yet to learn. Add [[Behold the Weave|Behold the Weave]], [[Cast into Time|Cast into Time]], [[Haste|Haste]], [[Loose Time's Arrow|Loose Time's Arrow]], [[Quicken Time|Quicken Time]], [[Slow|Slow]], and [[Stagnate Time|Stagnate Time]] to your spell list. You can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren't normally on your tradition's spell list.
