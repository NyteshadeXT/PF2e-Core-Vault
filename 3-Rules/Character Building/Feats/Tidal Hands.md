# Tidal Hands `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[3-Rules/trait_reference/water]]

**Category** class; 




With an emphatic gesture, you create waves that rush out from you in the shape of your hands. You either form two @Template\[cone|distance:15\]s that don't overlap or you combine the hands into one @Template\[cone|distance:30\]. Each creature in a wave takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. If a creature critically fails, you also push that creature 5 feet.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
