# Overlord
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dungeon]][[extradimensional]][[teleportation]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** You have fully cleared at least one floor of your personal dungeon
* * *
After conquering at least one floor of your personal dungeon and coming to learn exactly what that floor means about who and what you are, you've gained extreme control over the floor, enough to create a comfortable paradise where the monsters clean the floors and make the beds while the traps extend downwards to refill your drinks. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute to create a gateway into the safe portion of your dungeon. The entrance is a faint, shimmering, vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who can enter when you cast the spell. Once inside, you can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and the creatures you designated can reopen the door at will, just like opening a physical door. The gateway lasts until you spend 1 minute to move it to another location. Inside, the dungeon floor you've turned into your stronghold is decorated to match your taste, though it keeps to the theme based on your heritage (a private island for an archipelago dungeon, a floor of a giant tower for a tower dungeon, and so on). While the entrance is closed, effects from outside fail to penetrate it, and vice versa, except for plane shift, which can be used to enter the dungeon as normal. You can use scrying magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they're capable of crossing planes. A staff of monsters attends to your guests within the stronghold, works to farm or otherwise collect food on the dungeon floor, and cooks meals for the guests, able to feed delicious and filling meals for up to 150 people a day.

**Special** This feat is arcane if you are an artificial dungeon (such as a labyrinth or tower) or primal if you are a natural dungeon (such as an archipelago, caverns, or tree).
