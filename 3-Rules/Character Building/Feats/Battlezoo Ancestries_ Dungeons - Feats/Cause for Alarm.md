# Cause for Alarm
## Feat 5
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can draw forth magical alarms from within your dungeon to alert you of intruders' presence. You can cast _Alarm_ once per day as an innate spell. The spell is arcane if you are an artificial dungeon (such as a labyrinth or tower) or primal if you are a natural dungeon (such as an archipelago, caverns, or tree).
