# Call Forth Room
## Feat 9
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You pull an unoccupied room (or other similar area, such as an arboreal chamber for a tree dungeon, a coastal cove for an archipelago dungeon, or a small cave for a caverns dungeon) from your dungeon into the world in order to give yourself a safe place to rest. You can cast _Cozy Cabin_ once per day as innate spell, but the area is shaped like a dungeon room corresponding to your heritage, rather than a cabin, and you conjure it directly from your dungeon. The spell is arcane if you are an artificial dungeon (such as a labyrinth or tower) or primal if you are a natural dungeon (such as an archipelago, caverns, or tree).
