## Feat 13
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

In order to protect your core, you draw forth matter from within your dungeon's walls, floors, and ceiling to form a shell of organic or inorganic matter that protects your avatar, even as each attack chips through the shell. After you've activated your Dungeon Armor, for 10 minutes, you gain resistance 10 against physical damage, except adamantine. However, each time the resistance applies, the resistance value decreases by 1. When the resistance reaches 0 after reducing physical damage 10 times, the effect ends.
