# Dungeon Vault
## Feat 13
### [[concentrate]][[dungeon]][[extradimensional]][[teleportation]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can send treasure into a mostly-secure vault in your dungeon and retrieve it later. The vault is only lightly trapped, but the extradimensional nature of your dungeon keeps the treasure safe. You can spend 1 minute to send your treasure, consisting of items with a total amount of Bulk up to your level, into your dungeon's vault; you can Dismiss the effect to return the treasure back, though otherwise the effect has an unlimited duration.

The treasure can't contain any creatures, even if the creature is in an extradimensional space. Time passes normally for the treasure, and the environmental effects of the dungeon apply to it. Though very unlikely, it's possible for a creature in the dungeon to stumble upon your vault and make off with your treasure.
