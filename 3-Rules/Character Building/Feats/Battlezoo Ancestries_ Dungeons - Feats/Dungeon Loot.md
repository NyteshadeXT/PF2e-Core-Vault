# Dungeon Loot
## Feat 1
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can displace some of the awkwardness of the bulk and weight of whatever your avatar is carrying into your dungeon, allowing you to hold more than someone might expect by looking at you. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Athletics, or trained in a different skill of your choice if you were already trained in Athletics. You gain the Hefty Hauler skill feat.
