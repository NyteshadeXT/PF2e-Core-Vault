# The Dungeon's Magic Power is Omnipotent
## Feat 13
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Dungeon Dweomers
* * *
Your magical connection to your dungeon is so powerful that you have reached its zenith, drawing out spells from your dungeon that would take a skilled wizard or druid to manifest. Select one 3rd-level or lower spell and one 4th-level or lower spell, from the same spell list as your Dungeon Dweomers spells. They must be spells to which you have access. You can cast each of your chosen spells once per day as innate spells of the appropriate tradition.
