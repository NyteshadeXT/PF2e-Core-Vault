# Labyrinth of Magic
## Feat 5
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** labyrinth heritage
* * *
Some of the most trickiest of your inner labyrinth are magical mazes where illusions obscure the clues towards the true exit, and you've learned to call forth these illusory objects from the labyrinth. You can cast _Illusory Object_ once per day as an arcane innate spell.
