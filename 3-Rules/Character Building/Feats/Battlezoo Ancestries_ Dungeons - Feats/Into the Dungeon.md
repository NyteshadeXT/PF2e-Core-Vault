# Into the Dungeon `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[dungeon]][[extradimensional]][[incapacitation]][[teleportation]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** Once per day

* * *

You draw a foe into your inner dungeon, leaving them to wander the many paths until they find a way out. Choose a target within 30 feet. The target attempts a Will check save against the higher of your class DC and spell DC, with the following effects. Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as _Plane Shift_. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target isn't drawn into the dungeon.

**Success** The target is briefly drawn into the dungeon, but they are right near an exit. They vanish into the dungeon, but on their turn they can spend 1 action to escape.

**Failure** The target is drawn into the dungeon. Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check check or Perception check check against Into the Dungeon's DC to escape.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target must critically succeed on a Survival or Perception check to escape, or succeed on two Survival or Perception checks. If the target has succeeded at one of the required Survival or Perception checks and then critically fails, they lose their previous success and have to start over.

* * *

**Special** This feat is arcane if you are an artificial dungeon (such as a labyrinth or tower) or primal if you are a natural dungeon (such as an archipelago, caverns, or tree).
