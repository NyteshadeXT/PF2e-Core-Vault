# Call Forth Traps
## Feat 9
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned how to call forth some of the many traps from within your own personal dungeon and bring them to the battlefield. You gain the Snarecrafter Dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype. Any time you use quick deployment from the snarecrafter archetype, you are causing the trap to manifest forth from inside of your dungeon, rather than building it quickly, but the mechanics are otherwise the same.
