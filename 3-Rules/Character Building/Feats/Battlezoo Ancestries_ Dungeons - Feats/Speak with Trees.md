# Speak with Trees
## Feat 5
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** tree heritage
* * *
As the avatar of a giant tree, you find it natural to speak with other trees. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with either deciduous or coniferous trees, depending on which type of tree you are. The GM determines which plants count for this ability.
