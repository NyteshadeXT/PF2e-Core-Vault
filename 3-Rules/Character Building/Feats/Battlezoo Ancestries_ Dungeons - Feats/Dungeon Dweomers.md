# Dungeon Dweomers
## Feat 9
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Dungeon Magic or tower heritage
* * *
Your magical connection to your dungeon grants you more powerful dweomers, which you can bring forth into the world around you. Select one 1st-level spell and one 2nd-level or lower spell from the same spell list as your Dungeon Magic or tower heritage cantrip. They must be spells to which you have access. You can cast each of your chosen spells once per day as innate spells of the appropriate tradition.
