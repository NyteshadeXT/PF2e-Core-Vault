# Dungeon Lore
## Feat 1
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have learned about awakened dungeons in order to understand more about who you are. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and in either Arcana (if you are a labyrinth, tower, or other artificial dungeon) or Nature (if you are an archipelago, caverns, tree, or other natural dungeon). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Awakened Dungeon Lore.
