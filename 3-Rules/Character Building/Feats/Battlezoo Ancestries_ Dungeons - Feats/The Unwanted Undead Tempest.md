# The Unwanted Undead Tempest
## Feat 17
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Many creatures have died in your dungeon over the years, even before you became sapient. You can call forth all of them at once as an incarnate tempest of the undead; in fact, it kills two birds with one stone because you'd probably rather not have them haunting the place anyway. You can cast _Tempest of Shades_ as an innate spell once per day. The spell is arcane if you are an artificial dungeon (such as a labyrinth or tower) or primal if you are a natural dungeon (such as an archipelago, caverns, or tree).
