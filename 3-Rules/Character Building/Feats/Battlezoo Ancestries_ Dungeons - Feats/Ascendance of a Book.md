## Feat 5
### [[arcane]][[dungeon]][[extradimensional]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** tower heritage

**Requirements** You must have a hand free.

There's a giant library somewhere in your dungeon, and you can call forth a tome from the library, causing it to ascend to the top of the tower and then temporarily cross dimensions into your hand. If your next action is to Recall Knowledge, the tome appears in your hand, open to an appropriate page. This grants you a +1 status bonus on the Recall Knowledge check. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. If the roll is successful and the subject is a creature, you gain additional information or context about the creature.
