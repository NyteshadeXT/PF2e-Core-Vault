# Avatar's Adaptability
## Feat 5
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your avatar has become more and more able to fit in with other creatures of the same ancestry. You gain the Adopted Ancestry general feat for the ancestry that matches your avatar's appearance, and you also gain one 1st-level ancestry feat from the ancestry you chose for the Adopted Ancestry feat. The GM might determine that you can take certain feats that would normally not be allowed with Adopted Ancestry due to your avatar's physiology. For example, an avatar still couldn't take an elf feat that required living for a century, but they might be able to take a lizardfolk feat that required a tail, since they have a tail.
