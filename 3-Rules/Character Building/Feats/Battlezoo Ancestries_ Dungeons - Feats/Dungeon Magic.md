# Dungeon Magic
## Feat 1
### [[dungeon]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are able to draw forth spells from your dungeon into your avatar, granting you a cantrip. Choose a cantrip from the arcane spell list, if you're a labyrinth or tower (or other artificial dungeon), or the primal spell list if you're an archipelago, caverns, or tree (or other natural dungeon). You can cast this cantrip as an innate spell, either arcane or primal as appropriate.
