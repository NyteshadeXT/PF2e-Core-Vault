# Battle Canapes `pf2:1`
## Feat 7
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Rumplank Reveler Dedication; master in Alcohol Lore or Cooking Lore
* * *
You can pass around prepared drinks and payayos to give your guests a quick burst of energy. You consume the canapes yourself or administer them to an ally benefiting from [[Actions/Revel|Revel]], either adjacent to you or connected to you by a chain of any number of contiguous Reveling allies who pass the canapes along. Attempt a DC 30 Alcohol Lore check or DC 30 Cooking Lore check check. If you have legendary proficiency in one of those skills, you can instead attempt a DC 40 Alcohol Lore check or DC 40 Cooking Lore check check to increase the temporary Hit Points gained on a successful check to 15 (25 on a critical success).

* * *

**Critical Success** The target gains 10 temporary Hit Points. They lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute or at the end of the encounter, whichever comes first.

**Success** The target gains 5 temporary Hit Points. They lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute or at the end of the encounter, whichever comes first.

**Failure** The canapes have no effect.
