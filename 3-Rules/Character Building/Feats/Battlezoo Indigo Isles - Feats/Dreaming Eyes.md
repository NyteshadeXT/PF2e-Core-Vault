# Dreaming Eyes
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your eyes are adjusted to the variable patches of lighting found in dreams and mindscapes, allowing you to see in dim lighting conditions. You gain low-light vision, allowing you to see normally in dim light. If you have the shade-bound heritage, then you gain darkvision instead.
