# G'mayun Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You have learned about the ages of g’mayun history in great detail and studied deeper into the great song. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Performance and Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in G’mayun Lore.
