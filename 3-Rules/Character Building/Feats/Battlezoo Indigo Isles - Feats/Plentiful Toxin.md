# Plentiful Toxin
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Imaginary Toxin
* * *
By focusing on the metaphysical forces from the Dimension of Dreams coursing through your own body, you speed up your imaginary toxin's accumulation, allowing you to conjure your spiritual poison significantly more often than other bannogs from the Material Plane can manage. The frequency of [[Actions/Manifest Membrane|Manifest Membrane]] becomes once per hour.
