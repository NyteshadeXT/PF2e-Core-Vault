Around you, birds do not sing, insects do not chirp, and even grass does not rustle. You are a silence in the song of the world. When you use Silent Aura, your aura of silence extends in a 15-foot emanation and lasts for 1 minute. It deadens all sound originating in or passing through the area. Inside the aura, you and all other creatures can't be heard (and so can't be noticed by hearing alone), can't produce sonic effects, or use actions with the auditory trait, including verbal spellcasting. Depending upon the position of the effect, a creature might notice the lack of sound reaching it (blocking off the noise coming from a party, for example).
