# Dreamwalk
## Feat 17
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** No More Yielding Than a Dream
* * *
You walk through dreams with ease, flitting across the lacunae in memory and perception like a figment of the imagination. You become so dreamlike that you can use [[Actions/Just a Dream|Just a Dream]] once every 10 minutes.

Additionally, when you use Just a Dream, instead of taking a Step, you can teleport up to 15 feet in any direction to a location you can see. If you choose to teleport instead of Step, Just a Dream gains the conjuration and teleportation traits.
