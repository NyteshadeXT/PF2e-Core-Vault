# Conceal Suffering `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You take damage from a foe's attack that doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points.

* * *

You put on a brave act to prevent foes from knowing they have wounded you. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the number of Hit Points you lost from the triggering damage. However, such an act comes at a cost. After 1 minute, you lose Hit Points equal to the temporary Hit Points you gained after 1 minute.
