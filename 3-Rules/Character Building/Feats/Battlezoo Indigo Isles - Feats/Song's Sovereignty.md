# Song's Sovereignty
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Songâ€™s Secrets
* * *
Your magical connection to the great song is so powerful that you have reached the apex of that connection, drawing out occult magic that normally takes bards years to master. Select one 3rd-level or lower occult spell and one 4th-level or lower occult spell. They must be spells to which you have access, and they must be from the divination, enchantment, or illusion schools. You can cast each of your chosen spells once per day as occult innate spells.
