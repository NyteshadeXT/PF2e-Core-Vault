# Whimsical Inclination
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You flit about from interest to interest so often, you’re able to quickly latch onto a concept and gain a basic understanding of it. You spend 1 minute with either someone who is trained in a skill or a manual or other source of information about the skill, cramming basic information and performing basic exercises with the skill. When you do, you become trained in that skill. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
