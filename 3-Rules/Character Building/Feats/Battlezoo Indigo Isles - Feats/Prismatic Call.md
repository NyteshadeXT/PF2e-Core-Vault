## Feat 17
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[divine]][[force]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

Whether it’s the power of the g’mayun’s patron goddess Chira, the untamed chaos of the chaotic plane of Limbo, or the malevolent infinity of the Abyss, you call the power into you and cry out with devastating effect. The different emotions create spiritual forces, allowing g’mayuns to see the sounds with truecolor sight as easily as hear them, in a rainbow of prismatic colors. Other than being auditory instead of based on light, this has the same effects as a 7th-level [[Spells/Prismatic Spray|Prismatic Spray]], using the higher of your class DC or spell DC to determine the DC.
