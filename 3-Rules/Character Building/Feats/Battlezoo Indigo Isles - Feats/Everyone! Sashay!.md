## Feat 15
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[linguistic]][[mental]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Rumplank Reveler Dedication; legendary in Performance
* * *
You order everyone dancing along with your music to move at once in the same direction. You Stride in one direction. At the same time, all willing allies affected by [[Actions/Revel|Revel]] use a reaction to Stride in the same direction. Creatures stop moving if this movement would put them in immediate danger. Foes affected by Revel must attempt a Will check saving throw against your Performance DC, with the following effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The foe is unaffected.

**Failure** The foe is forced to Stride, but it doesn't need to use its reaction to do so.

**Critical Failure** The foe must use its reaction to Stride. If it doesn't have a reaction to Stride, you can choose whether to force it to Stride anyway or to have it remain in place.
