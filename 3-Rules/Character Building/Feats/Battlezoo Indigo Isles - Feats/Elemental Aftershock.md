# Elemental Aftershock
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** secondary element of death, fire, force, ice, life, lightning, music, or poison
* * *
When you critically hit your foe with a melee unarmed attack, you can unleash an elemental aftershock, causing lingering energy damage. This deals 1d4 persistent damage to your foe of a type associated with your secondary element: negative damage for death, fire damage for fire, force damage for force, cold damage for ice, positive damage for life, electricity damage for lightning, sonic damage for music, or poison damage for poison. As normal, positive damage only harms undead or other creatures with negative affinity.
