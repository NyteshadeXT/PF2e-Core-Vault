# Mutagenic Shriek `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Sudden Mutation
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You let out a warbling cry that makes the very flesh of your allies change. You and all allies within 30 feet are affected as if they had just used your [[Feats/Sudden Mutation|Sudden Mutation]] feat, gaining the benefits and drawbacks of the selected mutagen. If you possess the [[Feats/Greater Mutation|Greater Mutation]] feat, they benefit from the 11th-level version of the mutagen's benefits and drawbacks, but the duration for your allies is still just 1 minute, while you gain the full duration.
