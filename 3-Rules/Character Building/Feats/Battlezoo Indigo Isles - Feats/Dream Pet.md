# Dream Pet
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




During the hours of your dreaming life, you wandered the dreamscapes of the Dimension of Dreams. There, you managed to forge a close friendship with a magical creature, perhaps born of the Dreamlands' whimsy, or perhaps of its nightmarish aspects. Your imaginary friend can now join you and have adventures together alongside you during your waking hours. You gain a familiar. The type of animal you choose for your familiar is up to you, but most bannogs choose a rabbit or hare, or another creature with rabbit-like features. Your familiar gains the dream trait.
