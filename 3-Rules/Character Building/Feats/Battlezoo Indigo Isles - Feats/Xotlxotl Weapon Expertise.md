Your weapon skills may not yet be perfect, but they're definitely a few steps closer than most people's. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in xotlxotl weapons in which you are trained and the weapons listed in the Xotlxotl Weapon Familiarity feat.
