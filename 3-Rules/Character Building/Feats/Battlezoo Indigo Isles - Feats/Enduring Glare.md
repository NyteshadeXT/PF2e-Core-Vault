# Enduring Glare
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




The wave of force generated by your stern glare and buoyed by your unflinching willpower reaches magical heights, allowing you to create an angry face out of force to interpose for you. Once per day, you can cast _[[Spells/Forceful Hand|Forceful Hand]]_ as a 5th-level primal innate spell, but it takes the shape of your scowling face rather than a disembodied hand.
