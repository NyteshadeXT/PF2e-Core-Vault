# Push Past Death `pf2:0`
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You have the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

* * *

You refuse to step any closer to death’s door; instead, you wrench yourself bodily from the doorway, bust up the frame, and return for one final push to defeat your foes. You’re restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.
