# Interconnectivity `pf2:0`
## Feat 17
### [[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You are about to roll initiative.

* * *

You have mastered bringing people together to work in unison. Choose up to three willing allies within 15 feet. They can use your result for initiative if your initiative result is higher after seeing both results. For each ally who chooses to do so, you lose one action on your first turn of combat (you lose one action if one ally uses your roll, two actions if two allies use your roll, and three actions if all three allies use your roll).
