# Perpetual Awareness
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Trusting your other senses as much or more than your sharp eyes, you are always aware of movement around you that might manifest as danger to you or your column. You gain motion sense as an imprecise sense out to 20 feet. Motion sense allows you to detect motion through vibration and air movement. As normal for all special senses, creatures who know you have motion sense can take precautions against it.
