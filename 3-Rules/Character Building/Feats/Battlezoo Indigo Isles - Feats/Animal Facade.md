# Animal Facade `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[concentrate]][[polymorph]][[sprite]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Seeing a sprite can sometimes give the game away, so youâ€™ve learned how to take the form of a seemingly-harmless animal in order to lurk about unnoticed. Your animal form is a specific form from a Tiny terrestrial animal. This form is distinctive and unique, and you change into the same form each time. In your animal form, you might possess a distinguishing characteristic that hints at your true nature as a sprite, or there might be nothing to distinguish you from other animals of the same species. Using Animal Facade counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception, though only to adopt your alternate form. In this Tiny animal form, you gain the statistics of a 1st-level _[[Spells/Pest Form|Pest Form]]_. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your true sprite form by using this action again.
