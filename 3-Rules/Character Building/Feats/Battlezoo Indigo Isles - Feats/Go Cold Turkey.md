Using your magic, you help an ally tough out an affliction, which clears the affliction from their system but might be more dangerous than a more gradual treatment. Choose to target yourself or a touched ally, then choose one ongoing affliction from which the target is suffering. The target immediately attempts saving throws against the affliction with a +1 status bonus, until either the affliction is cleared or they have attempted five saving throws, whichever comes first. They take all the usual effects of any failed saving throws, so this could prove harmful to the target or even kill them if they fail often enough to result in death.
