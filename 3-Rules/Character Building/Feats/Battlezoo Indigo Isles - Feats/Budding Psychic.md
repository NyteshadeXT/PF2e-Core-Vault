# Budding Psychic
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your overlarge, strange ears can detect and transmit psychic thought to others. While you've yet to master this skill, you're a talented novice and budding psychic. You can cast _[[Spells/Mindlink|Mindlink]]_ as an innate occult spell once per hour.
