# Unbelievable Leaper
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your powerful legs make you an excellent jumper, allowing you to leap a far greater distance than even other bannogs are capable of jumping. When you [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] via [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], you can spend more actions to allow you to Leap farther than your Speed, up to a maximum of double your Speed for two actions, or triple your Speed for three actions; you still need to succeed at the appropriate Athletics check to jump these distances. When you [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or Long Jump, you don't automatically fail your check if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first.
