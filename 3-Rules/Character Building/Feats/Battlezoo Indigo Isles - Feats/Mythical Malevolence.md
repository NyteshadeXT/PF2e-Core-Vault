# Mythical Malevolence
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** master in Bacoo Lore
* * *
You channel tales of bacoo malevolence and trickster caprice, confusing and frightening your foes. You gain the [[Feats/Disturbing Knowledge|Disturbing Knowledge]] skill feat, but you attempt a Bacoo Lore check check instead of an Occultism check to use your Disturbing Knowledge. You can choose to affect any number of enemies within 30 feet only when becoming legendary in Bacoo Lore, rather than when becoming legendary in Occultism.
