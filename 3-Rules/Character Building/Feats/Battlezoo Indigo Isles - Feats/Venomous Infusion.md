# Venomous Infusion
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You can release venom into your foes after you land a telling blow, with extra effect if you’re using your tentacle from the tendrilweaver heritage. On a critical hit with a melee Strike against an adjacent enemy, you inject venom into your foe, causing it to take 1d4 persistent poison damage. If you have the tendrilweaver heritage, this persistent poison damage also applies on a critical hit with your tentacle Strike from the tendrilweaver heritage, even if you aren’t adjacent, and it increases to 1d6 persistent poison damage on a critical hit with your tentacle Strike from the tendrilweaver heritage if you’re adjacent.
