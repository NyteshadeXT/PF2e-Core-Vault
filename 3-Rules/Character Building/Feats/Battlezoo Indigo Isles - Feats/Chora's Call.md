# Chora's Call `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth the power of your chora to wreak havoc upon your foes. Elemental mayhem descends upon a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. All the creatures in the area take 3d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire, with a Reflex check save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The damage type for both the damage and the persistent damage depends on your chora, and Chora’s Call gains an additional trait depending on your chora. If you change your chora later in life during a major life transition, your damage type and trait change to match. At 10th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Chora’s Call increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level.

The damage type and trait for each chora are as follows: If you’re aikrys, the damage is slashing and the trait is air; if you’re carbor, the damage is piercing, and the trait is plant; if you’re farose, the damage and trait are both fire; if you’re hypisk, the damage is bludgeoning and the trait is water; if you’re jamambri, the damage and trait are both electricity; if you’re terath, the damage is bludgeoning and the trait is earth; if you’re vergiss, the damage and trait are both cold.
