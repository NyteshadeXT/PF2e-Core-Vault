# Demon Hunter
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You use the demonic connection that remains in the great song to hit them where they hurt and intuit their weaknesses. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage with weapons and unarmed attacks against demons. This bonus is equal to the number of weapon damage dice of your weapon or unarmed attack (starting at +1, then +2 with a striking weapon or unarmed attack, and so on). When you succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge about a demon, you always learn its sin weakness in addition to any other information; if you would have already learned its sin weakness, you learn a different piece of information instead. If you’re an ironbeak g’mayun, your beak unarmed attack counts as cold iron for the purpose of determining demons’ weakness to cold iron (but not other creatures weak to cold iron, like fey). If you are a nighteyes g’mayun, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Perception checks and DCs against demons.
