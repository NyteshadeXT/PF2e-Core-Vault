# Rending Squall `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You unleash your turbulent emotions in a sudden storm of screams or other loud exclamations, damaging creatures in the area of the outburst of sonic energies. The squall wildly surges, coalesces, and finally manifests itself in a 15-foot cone that deals 1d4 sonic damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude check saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After using Rending Squall, you can’t use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4 (level based sonid damage. 

**Special** When you take this feat choose for your Rending Squall to either have the divine trait or occult trait depending on whether you tap into the great song (which is occult) or a deific, angelic, or demonic source (which is divine instead). Rending Squall gains the trait you chose, as appropriate for its magical source.
