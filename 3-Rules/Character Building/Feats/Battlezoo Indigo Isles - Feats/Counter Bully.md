# Counter Bully `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** A foe causes you to gain the frightened condition

* * *

You are so used to dueling displays of dominance that whenever someone frightens you, you instinctively push back and intimidate them. You attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the triggering foe, and your vicious response grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation check.
