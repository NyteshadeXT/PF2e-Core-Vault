The food and drink you create is not only more flavorful but significantly more efficacious than is typical, even for other orpoks. Potions and elixirs you make that have an effect with a duration of at least 5 minutes provide their effects for an additional minute. If they have a duration of at least 1 hour, their effects last for an additional 10 minutes instead.
