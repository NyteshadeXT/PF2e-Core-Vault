# Dolent Aria `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[divine]][[emotion]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You sing a beautiful and mournful melody to inflict sorrow in the heart of your foe. One foe within 60 feet must succeed at a Will check, with the higher of your class DC or spell DC, or become [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute. Each time the foe is attacked during this time, they can attempt another Will save, ending the effect early on a success. Regardless, the foe is temporarily immune to Dolent Aria for 24 hours.
