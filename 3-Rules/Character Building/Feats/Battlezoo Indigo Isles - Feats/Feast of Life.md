You enter a gourmet rapture that makes it impossible to kill you as long as you keep eating. For 1 minute, you recover 15 Hit Points at the end of each of your turns as long as you ate or drank something that turn. During this time, you can Interact to ram your face into your supplies and munch on a normal piece of food without using a hand, but you can’t use this to Activate magical or alchemical food or gain any other special effects that require eating. As long as you ate food since your last turn, you can’t die from damage during your Feast of Life, and your [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition can’t increase to a value that would kill you (this stops most orpok from going beyond dying 3), though if your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] value becomes 4 or higher, you stay [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] until your wounds are treated.
