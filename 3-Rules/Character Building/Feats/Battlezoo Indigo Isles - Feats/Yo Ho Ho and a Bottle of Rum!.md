* * *

You withdraw and swig a drink of alcohol in order to overcome a difficult situation and give yourself a dose of liquid courage. Interact to draw a drink of alcohol and then Interact again to drink it; this can’t be a special alchemical alcohol that has additional effects beyond the base effects of alcohol. You gain 3 temporary Hit Points per level for 2 rounds and attempt a counteract check against a mental effect currently affecting you, using your Will save modifier as the counteract modifier and half your level rounded up as the counteract level. If the counteract check doesn’t remove the mental effect, you can’t try to remove it again with Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum! You don’t have to attempt a saving throw against the alcohol, and you don’t gain any other special benefits from other abilities that require you to drink alcohol, or that occur when you drink alcohol.
