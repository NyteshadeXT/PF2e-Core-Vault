# Bountiful Banquet
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Category** ancestry; 




You can summon extraplanar entities to aid you in creating a fabulous feast to soothe the body and delight the palate of all your guests. You learn the _[[Spells/Fortifying Brew|Heroes' Feast]]_ ritual, and you can cast this ritual without needing any secondary casters by increasing the Primary Check DC by 2, though in that case you must also make one of the listed Secondary Checks. You can use Cooking Lore for the primary check by increasing its DC by 2. If you make both modifications, the DC increases are cumulative.
