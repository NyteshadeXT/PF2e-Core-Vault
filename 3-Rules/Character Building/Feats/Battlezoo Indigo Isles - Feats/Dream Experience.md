# Dream Experience
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You're a clever and passionate dreamer, capable of carrying the strange skills and mishmash of experiences of your dreaming hours over into your waking hours, though this expertise is as fleeting as dreams themselves. Once per day, upon waking, you can select one skill. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the skill you selected until your next daily preparation, or if you're already trained in the selected skill, you become an expert instead. If you were already an expert or better in the selected skill, you don't gain any benefit from selecting that skill.
