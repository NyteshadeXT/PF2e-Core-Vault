Food resonates with the skill of the cook and the life energy of those around it, and you know how to tap into that information on a supernatural level. For 10 minutes, you can speak with any kind of food that’s been prepared for consumption.

While food is not intelligent, you speak with an animating spark within the food, formed from a combination of the ingredients’ fading essence and the cook’s mental efforts. Food doesn’t know anything prior to being prepared, but most food can describe anyone it’s been around since becoming food (including the person who prepared it) and might be able to opine as to the nature of the meal it was intended for: as a victory feast, common meal, meager subsistence, and so on. Food is surprisingly accepting about its ultimate fate of being eaten, and thus it doesn’t make any effort to avoid this topic. Fresh food tends to be lively and chatty, while food that is old or rotting tends to be slow to answer and churlish. The scope of food’s knowledge is up to the GM.
