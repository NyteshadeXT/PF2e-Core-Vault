Few can compare to your proficiency with the weapons hardriggans use. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency in your headbutt, all hardriggan weapons in which you are trained, and the weapons you are trained with from the Hardriggan Weapon Familiarity feat.
