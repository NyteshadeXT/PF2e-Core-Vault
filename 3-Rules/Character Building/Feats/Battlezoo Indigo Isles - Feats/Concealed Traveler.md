Your elders taught you techniques to travel safely. During exploration, you can use Bacoo Lore instead of Stealth when trying to [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]]. If you're leading while Avoiding Notice and allies are Following the Expert, you grant a +3 circumstance bonus instead of +2 if you're an expert in the skill you're using, and a +4 circumstance bonus if you're a master or legendary.
