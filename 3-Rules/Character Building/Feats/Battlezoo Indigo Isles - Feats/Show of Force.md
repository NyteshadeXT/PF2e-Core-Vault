You demonstrate your might by smashing something open. You [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] an opening or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] a creature, and then you [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a creature. You don’t take a penalty to Force Open the opening for not having a crowbar, and you don’t take a penalty to Demoralize for not sharing a language.
