## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Reality Shaper
* * *
You can sculpt reality as you see fit. The frequency of your [[Feats/Reality Shaper|Reality Shaper]] increases to once per hour. When you use Reality Shaper, you can choose to increase the area of your dream aura to a 30-foot emanation. You can extend the duration of your dream aura as a free action, and can extend the duration up to 10 times before you become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and are no longer able to extend the duration.
