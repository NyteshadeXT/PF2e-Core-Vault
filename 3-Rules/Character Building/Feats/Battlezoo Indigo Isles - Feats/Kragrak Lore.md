# Kragrak Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Youâ€™ve studied with the older kragraks in your settlement and learned about the elements and the world around you, as well as the old stories. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Kragrak Lore.
