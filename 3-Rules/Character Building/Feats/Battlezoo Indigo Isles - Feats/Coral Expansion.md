Magically removing the specialization that causes your body’s polyps to differentiate into your body, you transform your entire body into undifferentiated incredibly venomous coral tendrils, stretching out to reach a distant location, then rematerialize your form in that location. The tendrils stretch out in a 120-foot line and deal 18d6 poison damage to all foes in the line, with a Reflex check save against the higher of your class DC and spell DC, but you still have enough control of yourself not to damage your allies. Your movement as a collection of tendrils can still trigger reactions, but most reactions won’t affect you, except for those that would counteract the effect or that the GM decides would affect undifferentiated poison tendrils.
