Once, you were a fragment of a god. One day, you will become greater still. Your primordial blood bubbles up, your flesh twisting and ballooning into its new shape. Your progenitor form has the effects of a _[[Spells/Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]]_, but you must choose the specific form below based on your predecessor. If you can cast _monstrosity form_ in another way (such as from your spell slots or via a scroll), you can also choose to take the form based on your predecessor, but in that case, the damage increases by 5.

*   **Speed** 40 feet, swim Speed 30 feet
*   **Melee** horn (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d12+15 piercing;
