# Chochori Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




While the many chochori origin stories are varied and contradictory, youâ€™ve learned as many as you can, as well as all other sorts of stories about spiritual topics and forces of nature. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature and Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Chochori Lore.
