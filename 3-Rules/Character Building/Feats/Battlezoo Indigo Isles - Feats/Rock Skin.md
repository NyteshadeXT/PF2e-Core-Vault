# Rock Skin
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your earthen form is covered in a thin protective outer layer of rock that isnâ€™t part of your body, which can protect you from harm... at least until it chips away. During your daily preparations, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage (except adamantine). Any time this resistance prevents damage, it decreases by 1, to a minimum of 0. However, when your resistance is below 5, it slowly recovers itself over time; for every 10 minutes, it increases by 1, to a maximum of 5.
