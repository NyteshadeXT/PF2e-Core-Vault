## Feat 17
### [[healing]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

You quickly grow specialized polyps to replace damaged or destroyed parts of yourself, in order to heal yourself and replace missing organs or limbs. You temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to you at the start of each of your turns. While you have regeneration, you can’t die from damage and its dying condition can’t increase to a value that would kill you (this stops you from going beyond dying 3 unless you would die at a different value than dying 4), though if your wounded value becomes 4 or higher, you stay [[Unconscious|Unconscious]] until your wounds are treated. If you take acid or fire damage, your regeneration deactivates until after the end of your next turn. Each time you regains Hit Points from regeneration, you also regrows one damaged or ruined organ or body part (if any).
