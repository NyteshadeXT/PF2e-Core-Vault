# Spirit Spotter
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** truecolor sight ancestry feature
* * *
You have found a way to adapt the input from your truecolor sight that shows you magical effects formed of negative life essence and spiritual essence in order to notice hard-to-spot haunts and incorporeal creatures hidden inside solid objects. Even when you aren’t Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to notice incorporeal undead and haunts nearby, albeit at a –2 circumstance penalty. This benefit applies even if the incorporeal undead or haunts are hidden inside solid objects. If you are actively Searching or Seeking, you don’t take the penalty and instead get a +2 circumstance bonus on your Perception checks to notice incorporeal undead and haunts.
