# Bird Song
## Feat 1

**Category** ancestry; 




You can speak to and understand birds and their song, in large part because you feel that they are connected, in their own way, to the great song. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with birds. The GM determines which animals count as birds.
