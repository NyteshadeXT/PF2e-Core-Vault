# Remote Dreamer `pf2:3`
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




If you're adjacent to a sleeping creature, you can view their dreamscape, including its content, plot, and tone, as an observer. Nothing in the dream can perceive or interact with you, and you can't interact with the dream. Your target becomes temporarily immune to Remote Dreamer for 24 hours. You can't view the dreams of a creature that doesn't dream.

Once you are viewing a target's dream, you can continue watching the dream for as long as the creature remains asleep, or until you spend one action to sever this psychic connection. While you're viewing a target's dream, you lose all sensory information from your own body.
