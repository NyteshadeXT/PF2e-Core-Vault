# Rock Form `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You transform into a Medium-sized rock, disguising yourself from others. Perception checks don’t reveal your true nature, but a successful Nature check or Survival check check against the higher of your class DC or spell DC reveals that you appear to be a strange rock that doesn’t fit the area, and dissimilar from any similar nearby rock. While in rock form, you can observe everything around you, but you can’t act other than to end the effect, and your turn, by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. As a rock, your AC is 20, and only status bonuses, status penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. Any successes and critical successes you roll on Reflex saves while you’re in rock form are failures.
