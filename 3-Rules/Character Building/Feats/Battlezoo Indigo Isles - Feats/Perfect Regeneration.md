# Perfect Regeneration `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[healing]][[vitality]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** perfect healing ability
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You supercharge your natural perfect healing with mystic potency, gaining regeneration 15 for 1 minute, which restores 15 Hit Points to you at the start of each of your turns. While you have regeneration, you can't die from damage, and your [[Dying|Dying]] condition can't increase to a value that would kill you (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3), though if your [[Wounded|Wounded]] value becomes 4 or higher, you stay [[Unconscious|Unconscious]] until your wounds are treated. If you take fire damage, your regeneration deactivates until after the end of your next turn.

If you have the Perfect Recovery feat, each time you regain Hit Points from regeneration, you also regrow one damaged or ruined organ (if any), and during Perfect Regeneration's duration, you can reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the area from which it was severed.
