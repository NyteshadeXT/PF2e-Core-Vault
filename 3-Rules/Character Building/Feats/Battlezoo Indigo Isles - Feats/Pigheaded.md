Your stubborn will can save your life, even when you would otherwise perish. When you would die, you can attempt a DC 17 Flat check. On a success, youâ€™re instead reduced to 0 Hit Points and a dying value 1 less than the value that would kill you (typically, this takes you to dying 3). This has no effect against death effects or spells such as disintegrate, or other effects that annihilate you without leaving a body.
