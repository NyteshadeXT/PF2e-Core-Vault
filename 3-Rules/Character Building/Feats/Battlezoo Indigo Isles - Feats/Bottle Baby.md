## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You can bond with one nonmagical bottle you can carry that's sized to hold 26 ounces of liquid or less. To do so, you must invest in the bottle, transforming it into a magical item with the invested trait. While holding the invested bottle, you can use the [[Actions/Bottle Up|Bottle Up]] action to enter inside it.
