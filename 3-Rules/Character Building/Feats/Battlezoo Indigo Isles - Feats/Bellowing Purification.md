# Bellowing Purification `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### [[concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You give a mighty bellow that shakes you to your core, pitting your will against forces that assail your body or spirit. Attempt an Intimidation check check to counteract a single curse, disease, or poison that afflicts you. As normal, your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up. If you are legendary in Intimidation, you can attempt Intimidation checks against each curse, disease, and poison that afflicts you.
