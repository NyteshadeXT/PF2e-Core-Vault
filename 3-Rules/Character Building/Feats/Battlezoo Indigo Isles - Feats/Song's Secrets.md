**Prerequisites** Songâ€™s Sorcery

Your magical connection to the great song has grown strong enough to grant you more powerful secrets, which you use to your advantage, transforming the tunes into occult magic. Select one 1st-level occult spell and one 2nd-level or lower occult spell. They must be spells to which you have access, and they must be from the divination, enchantment, or illusion schools. You can cast each of your chosen spells once per day as occult innate spells.
