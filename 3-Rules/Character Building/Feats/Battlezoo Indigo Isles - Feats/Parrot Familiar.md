# Parrot Familiar
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You have bonded a parrot or other tropical bird as your familiar. You gain a familiar, and this familiar must be a parrot or other tropical bird. It still gets the benefits of familiar abilities, but its base form remains a parrot or other tropical bird. Because of its base form, it must have the flier ability.
