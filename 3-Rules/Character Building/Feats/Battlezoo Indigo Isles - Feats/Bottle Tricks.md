While you're inside your invested bottle, in addition to being able to use an action to leave the bottle, you can spend an action to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]], increasing the cover you gain from your bottle to greater cover instead of standard cover, to become weightless while inside the bottleâ€”allowing the bottle to float if it would float when empty, or to regain your normal weight when inside the bottle. You automatically regain your normal weight when you emerge from the bottle.
