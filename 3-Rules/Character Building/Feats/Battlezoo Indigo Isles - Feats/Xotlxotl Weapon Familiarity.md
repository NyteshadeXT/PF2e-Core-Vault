## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




There are certain weapons that are particularly well-suited for fighting in the swamps that you and other xotlxotl call home, and you've learned how to use those weapons efficiently and effectively. You are trained with blowguns, bolas, bo staves, longspears, machetes, spears, and whips. In addition, you gain access to all uncommon xotlxotl weapons. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial xotlxotl weapons are simple weapons, and advanced xotlxotl weapons are martial weapons.
