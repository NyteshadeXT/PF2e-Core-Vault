## Feat 5

**Category** ancestry; 




You can use the Craft activity to brew potions and poisons. You immediately gain the formulas for four common potions or ingested poisons that are 3rd level or lower. At 7th level and every 2 levels beyond that, you gain the formula for a common potion or ingested poison of your level – 2 or lower (a 5th-level potion if you’re 7th level, a 7th-level potion if you’re 9th level, and so on). You store these formulas in a formula book.
