# Sickening Toxin
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Toxicant Sentinel Dedication
* * *
Your toxin sickens your foe whenever it spreads fully through their system. On a critical hit with a Strike that applies the damage from [[Actions/Exude Toxin|Exude Toxin]], if the target takes acid or poison damage, they are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. If you have the [[Feats/Sweat Toxin|Sweat Toxin]] feat, the target is also sickened 1 on a critical failure if they take acid or poison damage. If you deal persistent damage to the foe with [[Feats/Persistent Toxin|Persistent Toxin]], the foe can't reduce their sickened value below 1 while the persistent damage lasts.
