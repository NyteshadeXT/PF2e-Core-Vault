# Volcanic Destruction
## Feat 17
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




While many kragraks envision volcanic eruptions as a primal and resplendent form of rebirth, you understand how to use them for destructive purposes as well. In fact, youâ€™ve even learned how to call forth eruptions at a rate that should alarm everyone living nearby. Once per day, you can cast _[[Spells/Volcanic Eruption|Volcanic Eruption]]_ as an innate primal spell.
