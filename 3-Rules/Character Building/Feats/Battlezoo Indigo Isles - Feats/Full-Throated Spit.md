**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Second-of-Five, the Venomous

You have grown acid-sacs in your gullet. You spray acid in a 15-foot cone, dealing damage equal to the damage of your acid spit Strike (including striking runes but not property runes) to each character in the area with a Reflex check save against the higher of your class DC and spell DC. You can't make any further acid spit attacks until an hour has passedâ€”you've used up all your acid glands.
