**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pirate Dedication
* * *
Using a piratical technique passed down by Poppy von Barnacle and mastered by few others since her heyday, you effortlessly pierce a foe’s defenses and attack a foe behind them as well. Make a melee Strike with a piercing weapon against a foe within reach. This Strike ignores an amount of the foe’s Hardness or resistance equal to your level. If your attack hits and damages the target, you can compare the result of your attack roll to the AC of a foe adjacent to the first target and in a straight line behind them. Use the same damage roll against the second foe. You can attack the second foe even if they would normally be 5 feet beyond the edge of your reach. Poppy’s Peerless Pierce counts as two attacks for the purpose of calculating your multiple attack penalty.
