You make two quick attacks against your foe, forming an X and marking a vulnerability for your allies to exploit. Strike twice against the same foe. If both Strikes hit, the foe is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until your next turn, and each of your allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus on their next attack rolls against that foe before your next turn. If both Strikes are critical hits, the circumstance bonus is +2 instead of +1.
