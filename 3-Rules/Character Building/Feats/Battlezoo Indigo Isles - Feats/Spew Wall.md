# Spew Wall `pf2:3`
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** perfect healing ability
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Over time, you gather excess flesh you no longer need as your body heals, mutates, and Perfects itself. When necessary, you spew it out into an enormous wall of spongy, slimy xotlxotl flesh. This has the effects of _[[Spells/Wall of Flesh|Wall of Flesh]]_, except that you use your key ability score instead of a spellcasting ability score if you choose mouths, and you use the higher of your class DC or spell DC if you choose arms.
