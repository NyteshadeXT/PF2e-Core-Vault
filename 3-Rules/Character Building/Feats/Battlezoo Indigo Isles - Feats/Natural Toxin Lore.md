**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Toxicant Sentinel Dedication; expert in Nature
* * *
Your knowledge of toxins is based on the principles of the natural world, but you can apply those same ideas to understand all sorts of poisons, even synthetic poisons. You can use Nature instead of Crafting to identify any type of poison, including alchemical poisons. You can also use Nature to Craft poisons.
