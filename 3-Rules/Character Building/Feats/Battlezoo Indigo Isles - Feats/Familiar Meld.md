# Familiar Meld
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Eld’s Familiar
* * *
The familiar you gained retrieves more of its elemental power, and it can meld into you in order to protect itself. It gains a familiar ability depending on the element of your chori as a bonus ability, which does not count against the normal limit to the number of abilities it can have. Furthermore, as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, when it’s in your space, it can meld into you. While melded, it can’t be targeted by external effects, and isn’t in the area of any area effects, However, it can’t act except to unmeld and separate itself out into your space again, which is also a single action with the concentrate trait.

The familiar ability your familiar gains for each of the traditional seven choras is as follows: If you’re aikrys, it gains flier; if you’re carbor it gains plant form even if it isn’t a plant; if you’re farose, it gains resistance and greater resistance to fire (but not to a second energy type); if you’re hypisk, it gains amphibious; if you’re jamamabri, it gains resistance and greater resistance to electricity (but not to a second energy type); if you’re terath it gains burrower; if you’re vergiss, it gains resistance and greater resistance to cold (but not to a second energy type).
