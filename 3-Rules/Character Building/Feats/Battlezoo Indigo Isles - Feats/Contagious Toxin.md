# Contagious Toxin
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Toxicant Sentinel Dedication
* * *
Your toxin leaps from victim to victim. On a critical hit when you [[Actions/Exude Toxin|Exude Toxin]] or a foe's critical failure against [[Feats/Sweat Toxin|Sweat Toxin]], you expose a secondary foe adjacent to the original foe, with a Fortitude check save against your class DC. If a secondary foe continues to critically fail their saving throw, you can continue to expose additional secondary foes, though you can't expose the same foe to your toxin more than once in total for each use of Exude Toxin or Sweat Toxin.
