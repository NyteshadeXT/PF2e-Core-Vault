# Booty Finder
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pirate Dedication
* * *
You have an innate sense for treasure and booty, and your larcenous nature and cupidity mean that you agonize over any such loot you might have missed through lack of searching. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find hidden treasure and when using Recall Knowledge to determine the value of treasure. Even if you arenâ€™t Searching, the GM rolls you a secret check to find hidden treasure that normally requires you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the treasure.
