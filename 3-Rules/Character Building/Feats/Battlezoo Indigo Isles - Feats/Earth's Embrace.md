You discorporate your body into a cloud of sediment (ash for ash kragraks, soil for boulder kragraks, salt for salt kragraks, or sand for sand kragraks) for 5 minutes, which is light enough to be picked up by the breeze. In this state, you’re amorphous. You lose any item bonus to AC and all other effects and bonuses from armor, and you use your proficiency modifier for unarmored defense. You gain resistance 10 to physical damage and are immune to precision damage. You can’t cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait. You gain a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny cracks.
