Your disappointment in the morals of those you've met causes you to reject conventional alignments. You gain resistance 3 to all alignment damage (chaotic, evil, good, and lawful). This resistance increases to 4 at 13th level and 5 at 17th level. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects dependent on alignment. If you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead, and if you roll a critical failure against such an effect, you get a failure instead.
