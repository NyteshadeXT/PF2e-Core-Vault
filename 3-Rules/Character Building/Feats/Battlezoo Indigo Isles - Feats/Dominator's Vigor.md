# Dominator's Vigor `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You give a creature within 30 feet of you the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition

* * *

You relish in the target creature's obvious cowardice in the face of your fearsome might, restoring your vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level. These temporary Hit Points last for a number of rounds equal to the frightened condition value you gave the triggering creature.
