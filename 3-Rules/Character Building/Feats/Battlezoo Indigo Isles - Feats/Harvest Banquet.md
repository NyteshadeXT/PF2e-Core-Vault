# Harvest Banquet
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** meleagris g’mayun heritage
* * *
Whether your ancestors learned to summon entities to create a fabulous feast from the local orpok or vice versa, you’ve refined your abilities to the point you can call forth a veritable smorgasbord without ritual assistance. You learn the _[[Spells/Fortifying Brew|Heroes' Feast]]_ ritual, and you can cast this ritual without any secondary casters by increasing the Primary Check DC by 2.
