# Cartilaginous Twist `pf2:1`
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per round

* * *

Your body twists and turns in ways that more solid forms can't. Attempt a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]. If you roll a success, you get a critical success instead, and if you roll a critical success, you can choose to Strike the creature from which you Escaped before deciding whether to Stride 5 feet. If you fail, you instead attempt to Escape a second time; you increase your multiple attack penalty as appropriate for both the actions you took, but only after completing all the actions.
