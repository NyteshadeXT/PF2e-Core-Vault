# Emissary Familiar
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Parrot Familiar
* * *
Your parrot or tropical bird familiar is a special entity called a divine emissary, which was sent to you from the divine realms with its own agenda. When you select this feat, choose an alignment that matches the familiar’s divine connection, either good-aligned for a familiar connected to the g’mayun patron goddess, chaotic neutral for a protean connection, or chaotic evil for a demonic connection. At the GM’s discretion, you can choose a different alignment and connection. The familiar has the alignment you chose. It gains the speech familiar ability as a bonus ability, which does not count against the normal limit to the number of abilities it can have. Furthermore, once per minute, it can cast _[[Spells/Guidance|Guidance]]_ as a divine innate spell.
