# Quick Disassemble `pf2:3`
## Feat 9
### [[manipulate]][[sprite]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** galtzagorri heritage
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding an item of 1 Bulk or less.

* * *

You attempt to quickly disassemble enough crucial pieces of the item you’re holding that it won’t work until someone fixes it. Make a Crafting check against the same DC it would take to Craft the item you are holding, with effects depending on your result. If you try to use this action on an item that is especially difficult to harm or destroy, such as a cursed item or an artifact, you automatically fail.

* * *

**Critical Success** You disassemble the item so well that simple repairs won’t suffice. The item is effectively destroyed and reduced to its constituent parts. You can choose to take the results of a success instead if you prefer not to destroy the item so thoroughly.

**Success** You disassemble just enough pieces that the item won’t work until it’s fixed. The item becomes broken.

**Failure** You aren’t able to disassemble the item, and the item is unaffected.
