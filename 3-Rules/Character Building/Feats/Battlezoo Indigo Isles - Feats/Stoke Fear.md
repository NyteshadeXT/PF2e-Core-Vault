# Stoke Fear
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your attacks show cowards that you are the dominant warrior. When you hit a [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] foe with a melee Strike, that foe can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn. After the first time this prevents the foe from reducing their frightened condition, that foe is then temporarily immune to your stoke fear for 1 minute.
