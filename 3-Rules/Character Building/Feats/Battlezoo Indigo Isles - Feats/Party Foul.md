# Party Foul `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rumplank Reveler Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** A creature benefiting from [[Actions/Revel|Revel]] rolls a critical failure, or rolls a critical success using an action that targets a creature also benefiting from the same Revel.

* * *

You call out when someone in your party makes a mistake, giving them an opportunity to correct themselves. The target rerolls the check and is immune to Party Foul for 24 hours. If the triggering action was a critical failure, this reaction has the fortune trait. If the triggering action was a critical success, this reaction has the misfortune trait, and you end the benefit of Revel for the triggering creature; if the triggering creature was a foe, they become temporarily immune to your Revel for 24 hours.
