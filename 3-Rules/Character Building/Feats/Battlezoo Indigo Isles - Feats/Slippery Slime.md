# Slippery Slime
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your body is covered with a thin layer of exceedingly slick slime, which lets you slip through places you most certainly shouldn't. You fit through tight spaces as though you were a Tiny creature (or one size smaller if you aren't Small), and can move at full Speed while Squeezing.
