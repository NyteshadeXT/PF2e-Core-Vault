# Wandering Waves `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[illusion]][[manipulate]][[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/mental]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature within 60 feet Swims.

* * *

You manipulate the triggering creature’s perceptions of the water, creating phantom waves and leading them astray. The triggering creature must attempt a Will check save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC, with the following effects.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The waves seem to be against any move the creature takes. The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain during its Swim action.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the Swim, though you can’t move it into hazardous terrain or a similar dangerous location.
