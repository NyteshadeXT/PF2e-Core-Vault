# Resonant Refrain
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Category** ancestry; 




You are so deeply connected to the various planar influences on your soul that you can physically travel to the plane in question, using the great song as the vessel and your own soul as the tuning fork. Choose Limbo, Nirvana, or the Abyss. You can cast _[[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Plane Shift]]_ twice per week as a divine innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to the chosen plane, and your soul serves as the focus component.
