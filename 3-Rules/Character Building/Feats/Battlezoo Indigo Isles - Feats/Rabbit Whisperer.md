# Rabbit Whisperer
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Like many bannogs, you've always felt a close kinship with ordinary rabbits, and you share many habits and eccentricities in common with your animal kindred. You recognize the twitches, body language, and rare sounds of lagomorphs as their own peculiar language. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with rabbits, hares, and rabbit-like creatures, such as jackalopes and almirajs.
