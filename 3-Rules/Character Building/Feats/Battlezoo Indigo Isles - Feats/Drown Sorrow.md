# Drown Sorrow `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** kayman heritage
* * *
**Requirements** You have at least one drink of ordinary alcohol worn, held, or otherwise easily accessible

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against a poison or drug other than alcohol.

* * *

Your body craves alcohol, processing it first before anything else you ingest and flooding out other toxins. You draw and chug a single drink of alcohol. Reroll the Fortitude save against the triggering poison or drug, taking the better result. You then become affected by Stage 1 of [[Equipment/Alcohol|Alcohol]] without a saving throw, or you advance your alcohol poisoning to the next Stage without a saving throw if you were already under alcohol's effects. You can only Drown Sorrow with ordinary alcohol, and you don't gain any other benefits from drinking the alcohol in this way, even if you have other abilities that grant beneficial effects from drinking alcohol.
