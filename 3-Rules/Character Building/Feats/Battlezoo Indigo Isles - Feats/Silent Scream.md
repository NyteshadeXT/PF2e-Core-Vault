# Silent Scream `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Sixth-of-Five, the Mystery heritage
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You unhinge your jaw and scream—a terrible, soundless shriek that is more felt than heard. All enemies within 100 feet of you must attempt a Will check saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, with the following effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]]. It's also [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round or until it's no longer frightened, whichever comes first.

Furthermore, you continue to scream until the beginning of your next turn—nothing can stop the scream save the total destruction of your body (for instance, by _[[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]_). Even if you are killed, your corpse will continue screaming. At the beginning of your next turn, all enemies within 100 feet of you take 5d10 bleed damage (with a Fortitude check save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) as they begin to bleed from their eyes and ears.
