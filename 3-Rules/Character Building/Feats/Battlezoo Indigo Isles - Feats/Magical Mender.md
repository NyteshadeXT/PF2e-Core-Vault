# Magical Mender
## Feat 5
### [[3-Rules/Bestiaries/Monster Core/S/Sprite]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a knack for fixing things magically, perhaps when others arenâ€™t watching. You can cast _[[Spells/Mending|Mending]]_ as a primal innate spell once per day. At 9th level, you can cast 2nd level _mending_, and at 13th level, you can cast 3rd-level _mending_.
