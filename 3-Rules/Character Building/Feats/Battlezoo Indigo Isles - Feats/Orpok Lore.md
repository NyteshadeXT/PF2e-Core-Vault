# Orpok Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You have spent a lot of time learning about orpok history and culture, and you know its legends, heroes, and recipes well. You gain the trained proficiency rank in both Crafting and Society. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Orpok Lore.
