# Perfect Recovery
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** perfect healing ability
* * *
Your perfect healing is especially quick, regrowing large parts of your body in mere days if you have enough sustenance. You can regrow an entire lost limb or organ in 1d4 days, though while you are doing so, you must consume enough additional food to constitute the new limb or organ (typically 1 week's worth of food each day to regrow an entire limb).
