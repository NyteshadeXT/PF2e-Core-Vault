Your connection to the great song provides you a hint of occult magic forged of the same sort of spiritual bonds and cultural unconscious that make up the great song itself. Choose a common cantrip from the occult spell list, or another cantrip from the occult spell list to which you have access. You can cast this cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. As normal, the cantrip is heightened to half your level, rounded up.
