# Rock Fist
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your fists are as hard as rock, allowing you to make lethal punches and similar attacks and push your foes around the battlefield. Your fists lose the nonlethal trait and gain the shove trait. Additionally, when you take this feat, you can choose to have your fists lose the agile trait and in exchange increase the damage die from 1d4 to 1d6. Once you make the choice to remove the agile trait, you canâ€™t change it.
