# Cooking Weapon Expertise
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Cooking Weapon Familiarity
* * *
Like an exquisite dish of warfare, you blend your familiarity with cooking implements with your class’s training and techniques in order to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency in daggers, filcher’s forks, hatchets, kamas, light hammers, and all orpok weapons in which you are trained.
