# Hardriggan Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You grew up among those who taught you much about hardriggan culture, and you learned all that you could. You are trained in both Athletics and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Hardriggan Lore.
