# Lucid Step `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




If you're adjacent to a sleeping creature, you can enter their dreamscape and become a part of their dream. While in the target's dream, you experience it as an active participantâ€”you can be perceived and interacted with by the dreamer, the dream's characters and contents, and other inhabitants of the dreamscape. You can't enter the dreams of a creature that doesn't dream.

Once you are inside a target's dream, you can remain there for as long as the creature remains asleep, or until you spend three actions to exit the dream. When you exit a dream, you appear on the plane that the dreamer is currently on, in an unoccupied space adjacent to the dreamer, and your target becomes temporarily immune to Lucid Step for 24 hours.
