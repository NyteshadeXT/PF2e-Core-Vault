# Sweat Toxin `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Toxicant Sentinel Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** An adjacent foe hits you with a melee weapon attack or a foe hits you with a melee unarmed attack

* * *

You sweat toxin from your skin, exposing the foe who hit you to your toxin. You deal your [[Actions/Exude Toxin|Exude Toxin]] damage to the triggering foe, who attempts a Fortitude check save against your class DC. If you have the [[Feats/Persistent Toxin|Persistent Toxin]] feat, you can use it to deal persistent damage instead when you Sweat Toxin.
