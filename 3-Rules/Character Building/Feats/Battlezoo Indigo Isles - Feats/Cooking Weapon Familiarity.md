# Cooking Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You are handy with cooking implements that might double as weapons in desperate straits, such as cleavers, filleting knives, and tenderizing mallets. You are trained with daggers, filcher’s forks, hatchets, kamas, and light hammers, and you gain access to filcher’s forks and kamas.

In addition, you gain access to all uncommon orpok weapons. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial orpok weapons are simple weapons and advanced orpok weapons are martial weapons.
