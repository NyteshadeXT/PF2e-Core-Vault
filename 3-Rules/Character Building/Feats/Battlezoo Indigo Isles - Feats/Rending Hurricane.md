# Rending Hurricane `pf2:0`
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Rending Squall
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

Calling upon a deeper source of emotion, you grow your Rending Squall into a powerful hurricane. If your next action is Rending Squall, name a source of emotional turmoil with which you are currently dealing. You feed the conflict into the squall, increasing its area to a 30-foot cone and increases its damage dice from d4s to d8s.
