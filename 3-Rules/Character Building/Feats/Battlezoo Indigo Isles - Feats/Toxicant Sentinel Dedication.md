# Toxicant Sentinel Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




**Access** You are a member of the toxicant sentinels who guard the wardens of the Violet Woodlands.

* * *

You've been initiated into the toxicant sentinels. You can safely live in the Violet Woodlands, despite the poison that suffuses the environment there. This doesn't provide absolute protection from poisonous hazards and monsters in the Violet Woodlands, only from the ambient environmental poison. Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Exude Toxin|Exude Toxin]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Journals/The Indigo Isles/Toxicant Sentinel (Archetype)|Toxicant Sentinel (Archetype)]].
