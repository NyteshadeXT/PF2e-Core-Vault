# Earthroil `pf2:3`
## Feat 5
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You attune yourself to the earth and manipulate its form as you command, creating a temporary region of difficult terrain in a 15-foot burst on the ground, within 60 feet. This difficult terrain formed from your Earthroil lasts for 1 minute before the earth roughly sloughs back into its original form.
