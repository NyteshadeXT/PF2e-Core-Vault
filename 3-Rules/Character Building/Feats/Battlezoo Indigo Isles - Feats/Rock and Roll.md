# Rock and Roll
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Kragrak Roll
* * *
When you perform a Kragrak Roll, you are an unstoppable juggernaut, flattening all in your path. If you hit an obstacle on any turn, including the first, the obstacle takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and you are unharmed. If this is enough to break the obstacle, you can choose to stop or keep rolling. If you hit a creature, you can try to roll over them. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] that creature, in addition to dealing damage; on a success, you can choose to stop or keep rolling, and if you keep rolling, you can move through the creature’s space. You don’t apply the multiple attack penalty from any such Trip attempts until after you finish resolving the full movement from Kragrak Roll.
