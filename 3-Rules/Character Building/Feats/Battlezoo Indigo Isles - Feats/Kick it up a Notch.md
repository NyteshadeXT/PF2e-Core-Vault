# Kick it up a Notch `pf2:0`
## Feat 15
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Battle Canapes; legendary in Alcohol or Cooking Lore.
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding non-magical food or drink and an elixir, ingested poison, or potion, or you are wearing them and have free hands.

* * *

You can season your canapes with a surprise kick. If your next action is to use [[Feats/Battle Canapes|Battle Canapes]], you can add an elixir, ingested poison, or potion to the ingested food or drink, applying its effects to the ally you chose in addition to the temporary Hit Points from Battle Canapes. Applying harmful or unwanted effects to your allies' food or drink is an evil action.
