You can shrink and bring one willing creature with you into your bottle when you [[Actions/Bottle Up|Bottle Up]]. The bottle gives the creature standard cover, and the creature can't act except to reemerge, which it automatically does when you reemerge or can do as a single action independent of you. If you have [[Feats/Bottle Tricks|Bottle Tricks]], the creature can spend an action to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] in the bottle to gain greater cover, and you can spend an action to adjust the creature's weight at the same time and in the same way as you do your own weight.
