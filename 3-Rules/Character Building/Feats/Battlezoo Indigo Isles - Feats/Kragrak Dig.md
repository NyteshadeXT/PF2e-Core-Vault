Using your connection to earth, you instantly dig a hole through loose dirt, dust, gravel, sand, and the like (though not solid stone) within reach, up to the size of a 5-foot cube. If you use this ability underneath a space occupied by an ally, that ally descends harmlessly. If you use it underneath a space occupied by a foe, the foe can either descend harmlessly or move to the nearest available space of its choice.
