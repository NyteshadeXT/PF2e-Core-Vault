# Toxin Advantage
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Persistent Toxin
* * *
It's easy for you to strike your foe down while they're ravaged by your toxin. Any creature suffering from persistent acid damage or persistent poison damage from your toxin is [[Conditions/Off-Guard]] to you as long as they're suffering from the persistent damage. If they're immune to both acid and poison damage, they aren't off-guard to you.
