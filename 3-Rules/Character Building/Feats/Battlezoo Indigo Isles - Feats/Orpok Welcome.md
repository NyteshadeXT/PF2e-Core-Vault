## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You make friends with other orpoks easily, and you have orpok connections in nearly every settlement where they reside. After you have spent at least one day in a settlement that has at least a dozen orpoks living openly there, you gain a +1 circumstance to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] or [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] in that settlement.
