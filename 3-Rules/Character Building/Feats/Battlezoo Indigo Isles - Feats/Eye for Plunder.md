You have a supernatural sense that allows you to quickly count items, which is particularly helpful in both legal and illegal professions. You are trained in your choice of Underworld Lore or Mercantile Lore. You can cast _[[Spells/Approximate|Approximate]]_ as a primal innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
