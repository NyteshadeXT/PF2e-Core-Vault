When your mind becomes clouded, you know to hit harder rather than smarter. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls on your melee Strikes equal to the value of your [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition (to a maximum of a +4 circumstance bonus) whenever you have the stupefied condition.
