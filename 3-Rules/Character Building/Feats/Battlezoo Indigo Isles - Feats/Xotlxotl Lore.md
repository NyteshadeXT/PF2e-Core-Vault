# Xotlxotl Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You know of the Five-who-became-Many and the Silent Voice and have learned the secrets of the quest for Perfection. You become trained in the Occultism and Survival skills. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in the Xotlxotl Lore skill.
