## Feat 17
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Song’s Flight
* * *
Your connection to your song wings has grown so strong that they have simply become a part of you. The wings you gain from Song’s Flight last for an unlimited duration, unless you wish to Dismiss them. If you do, you can restore them with a single Interact action as many times per day as you wish.
