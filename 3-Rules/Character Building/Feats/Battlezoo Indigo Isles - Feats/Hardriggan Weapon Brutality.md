# Hardriggan Weapon Brutality
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Hardriggan Weapon Familiarity
* * *
Your talent for swinging big weapons means you can get the most out of them when they connect, and you learn how to use them to their full potential. Whenever you critically hit using your horn, a hardriggan weapon, or one of the weapons you are trained with from the Hardriggan Weapon Familiarity feat, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
