# Protective Earthrune
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




Your earthrune transforms the outer surface of your body into a powerful protective armor as effective as a breastplate, defending you from physical harm. Your body is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16, and has the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove this armor, unless you retrain the feat and remove the earthrune. You can etch armor runes into your body to complement your earthrune, allowing you to upgrade your body’s armor as normal.
