# Imaginary Toxin
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You manifest a magical membrane over your hands that saps the imagination and spirit from your targets. You gain the [[Actions/Manifest Membrane|Manifest Membrane]] action, which you can use to create this dream membrane poison. You're immune to your own dream membrane. The save DC for your dream membrane is equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
