# Bannog Lore
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You're well-versed in the history of your people, and you understand the strange places and otherworldly realms where you and other bannogs live your waking and dreaming lives. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the Occultism skill. If you would automatically become trained in the Occultism skill (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Bannog Lore, Dreamlands Lore, and Mindscapes Lore.
