# Uncanny Vigilance `pf2:0`
## Feat 9
### [[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You attempt a Reflex save or you roll for initiative, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

Your persistent vigilance (or perhaps paranoia) keeps you safe and enables you to react to danger without hesitation. Roll initiative or the triggering save twice and use the better result.
