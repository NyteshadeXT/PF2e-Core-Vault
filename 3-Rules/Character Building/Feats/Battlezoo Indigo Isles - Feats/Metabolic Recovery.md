# Metabolic Recovery
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You’ve regained the ability to rapidly recover via fast metabolism available to kragraks in child form, but without any risk of burning yourself out. If you rest for 10 minutes, you gain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. This is cumulative with any healing you receive from [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]. Your bodily regeneration also works faster than other kragraks. It typically only takes you 1 day to regrow a body part the size of a finger, 1 week for a hand, and 1 month for an arm.
