By planning parties in advance, you can prepare to host a celebration at a moment's notice. When you roll initiative, you can [[Actions/Revel|Revel]] as a free action. If you're legendary in Alcohol Lore, Cooking Lore, or Performance you can use a reaction to Revel when you critically succeed at an attack roll with an improvised weapon associated with your skill (such as a tankard, frying pan, or guitar).
