# Kragrak Shard
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You can detach numerous small shards from your body and launch them at foes, as your body instantly regenerates the launched shards. You gain a shard ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet. The attack deals 1d4 piercing damage. Your shard is in the sling weapon group and has the propulsive trait. Like other unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with handwraps of mighty blows.
