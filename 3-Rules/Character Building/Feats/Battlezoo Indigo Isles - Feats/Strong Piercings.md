# Strong Piercings
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You have piercings that incorporate hooks or studs upon which you can, in a pinch, hang items. You can wear up to 1 Bulk of items that are each light Bulk or less, so long as each item has a hook or hole allowing it to hang on a piercing. Placing an item onto a piercing or retrieving it from a piercing requires a single Interact action. Your piercings allow you to wear up to 1 additional Bulk of tools (normally, 3 Bulk of tools instead of 2 Bulk), so long as the excess tools hang from your piercings.
