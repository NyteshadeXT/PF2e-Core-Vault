# Budding Hero
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You were budded from a parent, most likely a leader descended from a heroic line. Assuming your parent descended from heroes, your choriste expects big things from you. You’re trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy), and you gain the [[Feats/Group Impression|Group Impression]] skill feat. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against other chochori, which increases to a +2 circumstance bonus if you’re a master in Diplomacy.

**Special** You can only select this feat at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into this feat or from this feat.
