# Chronicler Obsession
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You are so obsessed with g’mayun history, finding the lost pieces and preserving what you know already, that you always know more than anyone else about it, and you never make a mistake. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to Recall Knowledge about g’mayun, g’mayun society, or g’mayun history. If you are a master in the skill you used for the check, you get a +2 circumstance bonus instead, and if you’re legendary, you get a +3 circumstance bonus instead. If you critically fail a check to Recall Knowledge about those topics, you get a failure instead. If you succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge about those topics, you gain additional context, and if you get a critical success,, at the GM’s discretion you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.
