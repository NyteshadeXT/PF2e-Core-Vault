**Category** ancestry; 




You can cast a simple magic spell drawn from the primal elements of the world around you. Choose a cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. As normal for cantrips, the cantrip is heightened to half your level, rounded up.
