# Reality Shaper `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[aura]][[concentrate]][[illusion]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You impose your dreams upon reality, shaping the surrounding terrain and disorienting your foes. You are surrounded by a dream aura in a 10-foot emanation. The area of the aura is difficult terrain. Creatures in the aura take a â€“2 status penalty on saving throws against illusions, spells, or effects that would impose the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition. This aura lasts until the end of your next turn. You're immune to the effects of your own dream aura (including its difficult terrain).

Each turn after the first turn, when you use Reality Shaper to create a dream aura, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the duration of your dream aura, causing it to last up to the end of your next turn. However, if you extend the duration in this way five times, you become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and can no longer extend the duration further.
