# Serial Liar
## Feat 5
### 

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception
* * *
You are adept at weaving multiple lies together alongside truths. Once per hour, when you Lie, you can combine up to five separate claims, of which at least one must be false. You roll a single Deception check for all the claims based on their combined implausibility.

**Critical Success** The target believes you are telling the truth and is so overwhelmed by your barrage of claims that they take a –1 circumstance penalty to their Perception and Will DCs against your Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks for the duration of your conversation.

**Success** The target believes you are telling the truth and is thrown off temporarily. They take a –1 circumstance penalty to their Perception and Will DCs against your next Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check during your current conversation.

**Failure** The target thinks you stretched the truth but isn't sure which, if any, of your claims are completely false. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation.

**Critical Failure** The target doesn't believe any of your claims, even the ones that are true, and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also much more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
