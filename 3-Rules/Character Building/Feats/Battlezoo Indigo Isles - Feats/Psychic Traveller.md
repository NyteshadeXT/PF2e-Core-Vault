# Psychic Traveller
## Feat 9
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You're a gifted dreamer, capable of amazing feats within the various realms of dreams and thoughts that even someone as skilled as you can't quite manage to achieve in the waking world. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls while you're within dreamscapes or mindscapes, as well as initiative rolls you make as part of psychic duels. Additionally, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC while in a dreamscape, mindscape, or psychic duel. If you're a master in Occultism, you gain a +2 status bonus to your AC while in a dreamscape, mindscape, or psychic duel instead of gaining a +1 status bonus. When you calculate your number of natural psychic spells in a psychic duel, you can add one additional natural psychic spell.
