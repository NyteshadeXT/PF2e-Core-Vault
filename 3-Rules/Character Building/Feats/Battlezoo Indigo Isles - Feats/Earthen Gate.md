# Earthen Gate
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Category** ancestry; 




Your attunement to the earth element is so strong that you can open gateways directly to the Elemental Plane of Earth, as well as make your way back to the Material Plane. You gain _[[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Plane Shift]]_ as a primal innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. You can use this _plane shift_ innate spell only to travel back and forth between the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Material Plane. Due to your body’s natural resonance, you can act as the spell focus, and you don’t require a tuning fork.
