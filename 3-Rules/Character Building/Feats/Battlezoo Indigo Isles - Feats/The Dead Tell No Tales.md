# The Dead Tell No Tales
## Feat 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Pirate Dedication; master in Intimidation
* * *
You remind others that the dead keep secrets best of all, scaring them into silence. Due to your fearsome reputation threatening others into silence (and explicit activities you take to do so such as using the [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] action), it becomes much more difficult to gain information you’re trying to suppress. Checks to [[Actions/Request|Request]] the information, [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]], or otherwise get someone to divulge the information in question when you’re actively attempting to suppress it, must exceed your Intimidation DC, in addition to all other relevant DCs. If they succeed at the other DC but not against your Intimidation DC, they are able to determine that people know the information but are too scared to reveal what it is.
