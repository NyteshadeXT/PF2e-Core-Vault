## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[earth]]

You’ve learned how to speak with the voices inside of stones, calling upon the vitae, the fragments of the Eld within all things. While stone is not normally intelligent, you speak with the vitae, which have a personality colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone’s perspective, perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human’s that it doesn’t consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about creatures that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath or behind them.
