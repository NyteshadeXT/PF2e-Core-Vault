# Coral Form `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You transform into a sessile Medium-sized patch of coral, disguising yourself from others. Perception checks don’t reveal your true nature, but a successful Nature check or Survival check check against the higher of your class DC or spell DC reveals that you appear to be a patch of coral that is strangely new to the area, and disconnected from any similar nearby coral. While in coral form, you can observe everything around you, but you can’t act other than to end the effect, and your turn, by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. As a patch of coral, your AC is 20, and only status bonuses, status penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. While you are coral, any successes and critical successes you roll on Reflex saves are failures.
