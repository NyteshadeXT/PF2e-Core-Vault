# Coral Reef `pf2:3`
## Feat 13
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth specialized polyps attuned to your own and form them together into a massive reef. This has effects similar to _[[Spells/Wall of Stone|Wall of Stone]]_, except the reef dies and vanishes in 1 minute if not conjured underwater. Until your next daily preparations, you maintain a link to a conjured coral reef through your shared polyps. This allows you to Interact with your coral reef in order to see through all of the reefsâ€™ spaces, and on the other side of the reef even if it would normally block your line of sight. This reef vision lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
