# Eld's Familiar
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestry; 




You have bonded with an extremely minor monster of the Eld, a weak eldamon, and brought it into phase with the material world in order to serve as your familiar. You gain a familiar. The familiar typically looks like an animal or other creature with minor elemental features that match your chora’s element. If you change your chora later in life during a major life transition, your familiar’s features change to match (this also changes the familiar ability it gains if you have Familiar Meld).
