You grow venomous tendrils from the ground within 60 feet in a 20-foot burst. Thin venomous tendrils grow out from the ground in the area. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain for 10 minutes underwater, or for 1 minute if the area isnâ€™t underwater, after which the tendrils dry out and die. A creature that moves on the ground through the area takes 2 poison damage for every square of that area it moves into.
