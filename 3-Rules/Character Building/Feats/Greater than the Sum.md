# Greater than the Sum
## Feat 17
### [[ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You call upon the familial bonds you share with other ysoki to defend them in battle. You can cast [[Enlarge|Enlarge]] as a 6th-rank primal innate spell once per day. You can target only yourself and other ratfolk with this spell.
