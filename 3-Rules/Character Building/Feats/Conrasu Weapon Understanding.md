# Conrasu Weapon Understanding
## Feat 5
### [[conrasu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have come to know conrasu weapons as you know yourself. Whenever you critically hit using a [[Composite Shortbow|Composite Shortbow]], [[Glaive|Glaive]], [[Longspear|Longspear]], [[Longsword|Longsword]], [[Shortbow|Shortbow]], [[Spear|Spear]], or a conrasu weapon([[Buugeng|Buugeng]]), you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
