# Animal Skin
## Feat 6
### [[barbarian]][[morph]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Animal Instinct
* * *
Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert. When you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms into a thick hide. You gain a +2 item bonus to AC (+3 if you have the greater juggernaut class feature). The thickness of your hide gives you a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +3. This item bonus to AC is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mystic armor, and bands of force.
