# Call the Hurricane `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[3-Rules/trait_reference/W/water]]

**Category** class; 




Massive waves spiral around you, with you as the eye of the hurricane. The waves appear in a @Template\[emanation|distance:20\], or a @Template\[emanation|distance:30\] if you're in a body of water. Each creature in the area takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is battered by the waves and pushed 10 feet (or 20 feet on a critical failure).

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
