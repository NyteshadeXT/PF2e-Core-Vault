# Dual-Weapon Reload
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload while holding two weapons. While you're wielding two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, you don't need a free hand to reload a one-handed ranged weapon you're wielding.
