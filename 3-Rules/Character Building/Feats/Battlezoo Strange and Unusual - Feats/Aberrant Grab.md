# Aberrant Grab `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### 

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aberrant Soul Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a successful tentacle Strike.

* * *

You grab the enemy you hit in your tentacle. The foe you hit becomes Grabbed, as if you had succeeded at an Athletics check to Grapple the foe.

**Special** You can use Aberrant Grab after Stretching Strike, even though the grabbed condition would normally end due to the creature being out of your reach. If you do, attempt an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, you pull the creature until it's within your reach and it remains grabbed; on a failure, the grabbed condition ends.
