# Extend Tentacle
## Feat 12
### 

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aberrant Soul Dedication
* * *
You can make your tentacle unnaturally long, allowing you to attack opponents with it from reach but not use it for anything else. Until you use Extend Tentacle again to switch back or change your tentacle back into a normal arm, your tentacle unarmed attack gains the reach trait, typically granting it a reach of 10 feet, but you can't use the tentacle to Interact, hold an object, or perform other actions.
