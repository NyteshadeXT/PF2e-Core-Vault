# Sense Aberration
## Feat 4
### 

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aberrant Soul Dedication
* * *
The itching feeling in your mind and soul grows even stronger when other aberrations are nearby, allowing you to sense their presence at all times, if not their exact positions. When in the presence of an aberration, you eventually detect its presence. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An aberration using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a Deception or Stealth check against your Perception DC to hide from you. If the creature succeeds, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Aberration for 1 day.
