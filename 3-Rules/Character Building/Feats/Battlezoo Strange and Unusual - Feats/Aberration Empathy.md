# Aberration Empathy
## Feat 4
### 

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aberrant Soul Dedication; Expert in Diplomacy
* * *
Due to your corrupted soul, you have a kinship with aberrations, allowing you to influence them more easily. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on aberrations and make Requests even if the aberration is mindless, if you don't share a language, or if their mindset is so alien that it's difficult for others to communicate with them. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on such checks. In addition, whenever you meet an aberration in a non-hostile situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail but can engage in 1 minute of conversation, you can attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special** If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is an aberration.
