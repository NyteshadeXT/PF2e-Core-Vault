# Aberrant Anatomy
## Feat 10
### 

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aberrant Soul Dedication
* * *
You can transform your body into an even more aberrant configuration with bizarre redundant parts, confusing vitals, and way too much acid everywhere. You gain the _Unusual Anatomy_ sorcerer bloodline spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point; you can refocus by concentrating on adjusting your bizarre aberrant anatomy and soul, either keeping the power under control or allowing it to run loose, depending on your personality and situation. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1.
