# Aberrant Soul Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You are a living creature
* * *
Through accident or intent, you are slowly transforming into an aberration. You gain the aberration trait, in addition to your other traits. You gain the ability to transform one of your arms into a rubbery tentacle and back as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While one of your arms is a tentacle, it can hold objects normally, but you can also use it to make a tentacle unarmed attack, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the agile, finesse, and grapple traits. Lastly, your partially aberrant nature inures you to external aberrations, even as it threatens to change you permanently from the inside, while alerting you through a strange itch in your mind to other aberrations' movements. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against aberrations.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Journals/Strange & Unusual Character Options|Aberrant Soul Archetype]]. Additionally, once you gain those two feats, the transformation progresses further, and you lose your other ancestry's other creature type trait (typically humanoid), fully transforming into an aberration.
