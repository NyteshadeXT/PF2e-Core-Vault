# Directed Channel
## Feat 4
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 




You can shape the energy you channel in a single direction. When you cast a version of [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] that has an area, you can make its area a @Template\[cone|distance:60\] instead of a @Template\[emanation|distance:30\].
