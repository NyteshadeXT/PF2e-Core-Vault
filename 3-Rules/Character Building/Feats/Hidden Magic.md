# Hidden Magic
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication
* * *
You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using [[3-Rules/Character Building/Spells/D/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] or [[Read Aura|Read Aura]] must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.
