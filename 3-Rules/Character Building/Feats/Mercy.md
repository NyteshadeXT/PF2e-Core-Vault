When you select this feat, choose one of the following options, which determines the conditions you can choose:

*   **Mercy of the Body** [[Blinded|Blinded]], [[Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Deafened|Deafened]], [[Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], [[Sickened|Sickened]];
    
*   **Mercy of Grace** [[Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed|Paralyzed]];
