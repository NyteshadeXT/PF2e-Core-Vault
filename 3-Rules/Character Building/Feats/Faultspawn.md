# Faultspawn
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You bear a grudge, inherited from a blasphemous asura forebear in your bloodline, against a particular deity and their works. You also have some vestigial signs of your previous incarnation, such as a second set of shoulder blades without usable arms, a set of mostly closed eyes where no eyes belong, or strange scarring reminiscent of a mouth.

You gain the [[Actions/Find Fault|Find Fault]] reaction.
