# Vestige's Breath `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with a breath weapon that deals acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing,  positive, slashing, or sonic damage in a cone or line
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You incorporated a vestige into your gear from a creature with a breath weapon, such as a dragon's head on your shield, and you can make it breathe on your foes. You deal 1d6 damage per level of a type of damage depending on the breath weapon of the monster you chose when you took this feat. The breath weapon affects either 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line, with a basic Reflex save based on your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

**Special** When you gain this feat, choose a monster with a breath weapon you've defeated and type of damage for the breath weapon from the list of damage types in the prerequisite, based on the monsters you've defeated and the vestiges you've collected. If the monster has a breath weapon that deals multiple qualifying damage types, choose one of them. The breath weapon's shape, cone or line, depends on the monster you chose. Once you choose a monster for the breath weapon, you can't change that choice without retraining this feat.
