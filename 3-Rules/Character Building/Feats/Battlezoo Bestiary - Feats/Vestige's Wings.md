# Vestige's Wings
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with a fly Speed
* * *
You embraced a vestige from a flying monster allowing you to fly. This is almost always in the form of a set of wings on your back, but it could be something more esoteric from a creature that flies without wings. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.
