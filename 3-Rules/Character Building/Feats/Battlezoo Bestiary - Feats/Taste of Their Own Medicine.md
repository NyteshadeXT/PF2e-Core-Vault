# Taste of Their Own Medicine
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monster Mage Dedication
* * *
Due to the sympathetic magic connecting you and your tokens, your spells are particular effective against the creatures whose token you used to cast them. Whenever you cast a monster mage spell against the exact same kind of creature whose token you used to prepare that spell, your target takes a -2 status penalty to their AC and saves against the spell. At the GM's discretion, if the creature is very similar but not the same (for instance, a lamia and a lamia matriarch might be similar enough, but not two creatures whose only thing they share in common is that they are both demons) the target might take a -1 status penalty to their AC and saves against the spell.
