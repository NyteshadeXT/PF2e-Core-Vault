# Vestige's Constrict `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with Constrict or Greater Constrict
* * *
**Requirements** You have a foe Grabbed.

* * *

You grafted a vestige into your gear from a creature known for constricting its foes, often a tentacle, tendril, coil, or other constricting feature. The vestige instinctively crushes your grabbed foe. The foe takes damage equal to your level + your Strength modifier, with a basic Fortitude save, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
