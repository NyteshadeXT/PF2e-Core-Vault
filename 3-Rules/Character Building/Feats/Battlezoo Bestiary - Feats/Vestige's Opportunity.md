# Vestige's Opportunity `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with Attack of Opportunity
* * *
**Requirements** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

You built a vestige into your weapons from a monster that knew how to take advantage of openings, typically a piece of the monster that it used to make unarmed attacks. The monster's parts twitch slightly during battles, and when a foe drops their guard, they attack. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
