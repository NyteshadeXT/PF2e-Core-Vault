# Vestige's Stampede `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with Trample
* * *
You added a vestige from a trampling monster to your leg or footwear, allowing you to trample your foes underfoot. This often incorporates parts from the monster's own legs and feet, and when you use Vestige's Stampede, your own legs might briefly grow larger and embody the creature's essence more fully. You Stride up to double your Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures at least one size smaller, trampling each creature whose space you enter. You can attempt to trample the same creature only once in a single use of Vestige's Stampede. You deal bludgeoning damage for your foot unarmed attack, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is better.

**Special** When you take this feat, you gain a foot unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is in the brawling weapon group. If you already have a better foot unarmed attack, you can use that instead.
