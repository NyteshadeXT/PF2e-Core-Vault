# Directed Audience
## Feat 2
### [[bard]]

**Category** class; 




You can shape the area of your composition spells. Whenever you cast a composition spell whose area is an emanation, you can change the spell's area to a cone 10 feet larger, to a maximum of twice the original area. For example, you could modify a composition spell that affects a @Template\[emanation|distance:30\] to affect a @Template\[cone|distance:40\], but a @Template\[emanation|distance:5\] could only become a @Template\[cone|distance:10\].
