# Animal Magic
## Feat 9
### [[beastkin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your shapeshifting grants you a magical connection to the animal world. You can cast [[Animal Messenger|Animal Messenger]], [[Calm|Calm]] (animals only), and [[Speak with Animals|Speak with Animals]] as 2nd-rank primal innate spells once per day each. These spells use your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
