# Primal Howl `pf2:2`

### [[primal]][[3-Rules/Trait Reference/S/sonic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Your familiar screeches and howls, empowered with natural magic. All creatures in a @Template\[cone|distance:30\] take 0d6 sonic damage for every 2 levels your companion has, with a Fortitude check save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]], and creatures that critically fail become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. The fright is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.
