# Frozen Sap

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Exposure to cold dulls an embersap ooze's flames and solidifies the sap that forms its body. It gains weakness to cold equal to your level. You can spend an additional familiar ability, either permanently or on a per-day basis, to reinforce the embersap ooze's body, removing this weakness.
