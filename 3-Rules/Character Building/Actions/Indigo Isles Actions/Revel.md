# Revel `pf2:1`

### [[aura]][[emotion]][[3-Rules/Trait Reference/M/mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Effect** Choose Alcohol Lore, Cooking Lore, or Performance. Until the end of your next turn, you and all allies in a 60-foot emanation gain a +1 status bonus to skill checks, as well as to one saving throw depending on the skill you chose. If you chose Alcohol Lore, you grant the bonus to Fortitude saves, if you chose Cooking Lore, you grant the bonus to Will saves, and if you chose Performance, you grant the bonus to Reflex saves. After the Revel ends, you can't Revel again for 1 round. You can allow foes to be affected by Revel if you wish. If you do, you can rescind the invitation and cancel the benefits of Revel for that creature as a free action. Once the invitation is rescinded, the foe becomes temporarily immune to your Revel for 24 hours. This doesn't allow you to use other Rumplank reveler actions that only work on allies or your foes.
