# Inkwell

### 

**Category** familiar; 




A typical healthy toogtoog produces enough ink to fill a standard ink vial every day. Toogtoog familiars can also choose to produce a different type of ink that is well-suited for tattoos. This faintly magical ink is nontoxic and resistant to fading. The toogtoog's master can recolor this ink at will, allowing them to alter the color of tattoos or even make them [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] if desired. Despite being a minion, your toogtoog familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to Aid you on a Crafting check to create a tattoo or other ink-based artwork (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.
