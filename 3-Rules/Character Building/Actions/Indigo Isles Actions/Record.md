# Record

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Once per day, your mechanical parrot can listen carefully to and memorizes a snippet up to 1 minute worth of sound down to the slightest detail. The parrot can then reproduce the sound at any time on command. When repeating a memorized snippet, the parrot gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Deception checks to sound like the original source. A mechanical parrot can only remember one snippet at a time in this way; once it memorizes a new snippet, the previous one is lost.
