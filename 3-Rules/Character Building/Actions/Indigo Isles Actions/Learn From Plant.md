# Learn From Plant `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You commune with a living plant that you are touching. You can use the Bacoo Lore or Nature skill to gain one piece of information. Though this is the plant's knowledge and not your own, this otherwise has the effects of Recall Knowledge about events that occurred during the last week within a 30-foot emanation around the plant. As when using _[[Spells/Speak with Plants|Speak with Plants]]_ to converse with them, most normal plants have a distinctive view of the world around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity.
