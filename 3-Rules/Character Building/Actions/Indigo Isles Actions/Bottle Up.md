# Bottle Up `pf2:1`

### [[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You are touching your invested bottle

* * *

**Effect** You shrink and enter the invested bottle you are touching. The bottle appears to be corked while you are inside. The bottle gives you standard cover, but you can't act except to reemerge, which you can do as a single action. You automatically reemerge from the bottle if the bottle is destroyed. The bottle shares the breathability and temperature of its surroundings but otherwise shelters you from basic weather conditions. You can bring your worn and carried items into the bottle with you (up to 10 Bulk maximum), even though they normally wouldn't fit into the bottle, but they leave the bottle with you when you reemerge. Shrinking yourself and your gear in this way doesn't change your weight.
