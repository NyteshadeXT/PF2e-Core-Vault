# Cosmic Insight `pf2:2`

### [[fortune]][[occult]]

**Category** familiar; 




**Frequency** Once per day

* * *

**Effect** An astroloptera can peer into the near future, granting their master a vision of a possible future. Select one action that the astroloptera's master could reasonably perform in the next minute that requires rolling a 1d20, and roll that d20 in advance. The astroloptera's master automatically receives that result the first time they take that action within the next minute; if they do not wish to receive that result, they can instead spend 1 action with the manipulate trait to perform a quick series of gestures to ward off ill fortune; if they do so, they instead roll the d20 associated with the check normally.
