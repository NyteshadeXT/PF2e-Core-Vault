# Toogtoog Tattoo

### 

**Category** familiar; 




A stylized tattoo of a toogtoog appears on your body. The toogtoog can spend a single action, which has the magical, move, and transmutation traits, to meld into or exit the tattoo. It must be adjacent to you to meld into your tattoo, and it exits your tattoo in an open space adjacent to you. Any of the familiar's companion items remain on it, but it can't carry any other items with it. While melded in the tattoo, the only action it can use is the action to exit the tattoo. If your toogtoog familiar dies, this tattoo loses its magic and becomes a mundane tattoo. You can alter the color of the tattoo's ink as normal for tattoos produced by toogtoog ink.
