# Evaporation

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Under normal conditions, seafoam spirits can extract enough water from the air, soil, puddles, or other sources to replenish what they lose. When in particularly arid environments such as a desert, seafoam spirits experience a slow evaporation of their bodies. They must consume at least 1 gallon of water every 2 hours in such environments or become [[Slowed|Slowed 1]] until they replenish their lost water. If a seafoam spirit goes at least 24 hours in an arid environment without water, they fall into a state of torpor and do not awaken until rehydrated. Seafoam spirits have weakness 5 to effects based on dehydration.
