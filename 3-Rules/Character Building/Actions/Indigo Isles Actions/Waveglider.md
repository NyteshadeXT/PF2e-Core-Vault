### 

**Category** familiar; 




A seafoam spirit is always surrounded by a wave of seawater that moves along with it, allowing it to Swim wherever it goes. This water provides a buffer between the spirit and airborne toxins, granting it a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled effects.
