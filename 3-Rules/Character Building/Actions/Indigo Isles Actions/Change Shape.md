# Change Shape `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** familiar; 




The seafoam changes its shape from its default form as an amorphous blob of water to the form of a Tiny aquatic animal that lives in saltwater. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. The seafoam spirit's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether it is an aquatic animal, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. The seafoam spirit doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. As a part of this transformation, the seafoam spirit can swap out any familiar abilities specifically based on its physical form to better fit its new form (though it can't swap out amphibious or gills, since it always changes to an aquatic creature, which means only a seafoam spirit with more than the minimum number of familiar abilities will have enough abilities to switch them out). For example, a seafoam spirit might have darkvision to represent its form as a deep sea anglerfish with ability to see in the dark that it swaps out for burrower when it transforms into an oyster.
