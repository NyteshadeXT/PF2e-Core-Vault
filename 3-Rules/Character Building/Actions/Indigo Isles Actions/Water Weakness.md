# Water Weakness

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your wildfire leshy familiar has weakness to water equal to your level. In addition to damaging effects with the water trait, as normal, the weakness applies when your wildfire leshy is exposed to a nondamaging water effect, such as when it's doused with water (either through a spell or some other effect, such as pouring a bucket of water over it or being caught in the rain). You can spend an additional familiar ability, either permanently or on a per-day basis, to reinforce your wildfire leshy and waterproof it, removing this weakness.
