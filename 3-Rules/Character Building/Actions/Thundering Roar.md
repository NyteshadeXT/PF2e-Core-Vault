**Category** offensive; 




The target unleashes a powerful vocalization. Each enemy in a 10- foot emanation takes 4d8 sonic damage with a basic Will save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its Will save is also [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Heightened (+2)** The damage from the roar increases by 2d8.
