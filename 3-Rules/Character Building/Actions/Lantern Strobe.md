# Lantern Strobe `pf2:2`

### [[3-Rules/Trait Reference/L/light]][[3-Rules/Rule References/Magical]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** As you pulse your lantern, your emitters flash erratically, disorienting your opponents that see it. Each opponent in a @Template\[cone|distance:15\] must attempt a Fortitude check save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled for the following round.
