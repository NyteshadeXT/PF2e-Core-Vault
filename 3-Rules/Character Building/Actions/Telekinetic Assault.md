# Telekinetic Assault `pf2:2`

### [[3-Rules/Rule References/Divine]]






Your ghost unleashes a flurry of emotions, causing small objects and debris to fly about in a @Template\[emanation|distance:20\], dealing 1d6 bludgeoning for every 2 levels the ghost has (basic Reflex save). This uses a trained DC using the ghost's Charisma modifier or an expert DC if the ghost is specialized.
