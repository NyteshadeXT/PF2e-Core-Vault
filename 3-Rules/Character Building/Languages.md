# Modern Languages
## Adlet
The language of the adlet, a snow-wolf-like humanoid species.

## Alghollthu
The language of alghollthus, also known as the Aboleth language, is one of the oldest on the face (and below the waters) of Golarion. It is spoken by the various species of alghollthus as well as some of their traditional enemies.

## Amurrun
In addition to Taldane, most catfolk also speak their own language, called "Amurrun", which is also the term they use for themselves. Amurrun is spoken widely in the large community of catfolk living in the Valashmai Jungle. As the language of catfolk, this language is sometimes also referred to as Catfolk.

## Arboreal
The language of arboreals and other plant-like creatures is presumably used during moots. Arboreal regents are also known as "treants", so this language is sometimes also referred to as Treant.

## Boggard
This language of croaks and belched pops is spoken by the boggards of the Mushfens in Varisia. A crude pidgin of it is also spoken by marsh giants, and is supposedly even more disgusting to hear.

## Ceratioidi
The language of the ceratioidi.

## Cyclops
The language of the cyclops was also once spoken by giants. It developed before the coming of humans, among the cyclops of the legendary realm of Ghol-Gan.

## Draconic
Draconic is among the oldest, if not the oldest, language of the multiverse. Because of this, nearly all other languages can trace some roots back to this primordial tongue. Draconic has a throaty character and defaults to an imperative tone. It bears a tonal sound to non-dragons, a trait that dragons themselves deny; however, dragons speaking draconic emit a form of vibration that communicates subtext that non-dragons can neither produce nor perceive.

## Drooni
Drooni is the language of the lizardfolk nation of Droon in Southern Garund and also serves as the trade language for other nations in the region, including Holomog.

## Dwarven
Dwarven is a clipped language of hard consonants and guttural pronunciation. Dwarven shares its runic alphabet with Petran, along with a number of other similarities. Dwarven names are full of harsh-sounding consonants, and rarely include soft, or sibilant sounds. Honorifics are common in given names, such as "-sun" ("-son"), "-dam" ("-daughter"), and "-hild" ("-wife"). Family names sometimes contain words in Common such as "gold" or "hammer". Also, the letters Q and X do not appear in Dwarven. Dörak is a dwarven term meaning "off-plan", which is not a good thing for dwarves to do.

## Elven
Elven or Elvish is believed to be among the eldest, if not the eldest of the languages mortals speak on Golarion. Scholars conjecture that it was formed when elven speakers of Fey tried to introduce grammatical rules and vocabulary from both Empyrean and Draconic. The elven alphabet contains thirty-three letters (twenty-four consonants and nine vowels). It is a complex language, but sounds poetic in tone and cadence.

## Ekujae shape-script
The Ekujae elves of the Mwangi Expanse encode knowledge and history into patterns cultivated into plants known as record trees. Such trees are a three-dimensional shape-script that Ekujae learn to interpret and write at an early age, and their half-elves can often transcribe it into more portable or rudimentary forms, including an adapted two-dimensional script.

## Fey
The language of the fey, also known as Sylvan, is one of the most linguistically static of all languages. Thought to be nearly as old as Draconic or Chthonian, Fey has a tiny vocabulary that has barely changed over the eons. 

## Garuda
Garuda is the name of the language and the name of the creature that speaks it. Garudas are brightly coloured avian creatures living in tropical climates, including on the island nation of Jalmeray. Garudas, being intelligent creatures, may also speak Common tongues and Vudrani.

## Giant
The language of the various races of giants—sometimes called Jotun, or more simply, Giant—that exists today is a mixture of Cyclops and Thassilonian. First used by the giant slaves of the runelords in the time before Earthfall, it spread to the rest of Golarion after the destruction of that realm.

## Girtablilu
Girtablilu is the language spoken by the humanoid-scorpion hybrid creatures of the same name.

## Gnome
In terms of the sheer number of words in its vocabulary, Gnome, or Gnomish, is the largest language known. It has changed dramatically since gnomes first introduced it to Golarion, a process which has by no means halted. It shares certain similarities with both Aklo and Fey.

## Goblin
Goblin vocabulary is shared by the goblin, bugbear, and hobgoblin races, even if the pronunciations, inflections, and usage differs wildly among them. When spoken by goblins, it is nearly incomprehensible to outsiders, and sounds more like high-pitched yapping. Among the martial hobgoblins, it takes the form of short, barked commands, while the bugbears speak their taunts with a sibilance not heard among the other goblinoid races. It is an extremely flexible language, containing a plethora of terms related to subservience, fear, and death.

## Goloma
Golomas of the Mwangi Expanse have their own language, which is also called Goloma. They struggle to pronounce soft syllables, and often feature hard consonants and individual vowel enunciation in their names and language.

## Halfling
The language of halflings is believed to have developed from a coded version of Taldane and Varisian. It was first used in Cheliax among the halfling slave population and eventually spread across Avistan and Garund. The language has many regional dialects to the point that halflings may find difficulty communicating with foreign halflings in complex areas. Modern halfling has the same grammar structure as Azlanti; scholars can only suggest why this is the case, but it tends to suggest halflings were present within the ancient Azlanti empire alongside the humans.

Iruxi
Many lizardfolk speak a language common to their ancestry known as Iruxi, which is also the language's word for their ancestry.

## Kasatha
Kasathas are four-armed humanoids who have their own language, also called Kasatha.

## Kashrishi
Kashrishi speak their own language, also called Kashrishi.

## Kech
Keches are evil simian creatures found in warm jungles who have their own language, also called Kech.

## Kholo
The Kholo language, named for its primary speakers and also known generically as Gnoll, is hard for non-kholo to understand and speak because it is made up of countless barks, growls, and yips. Like many other racial languages, its construction is a clear reflection of the cultural priorities of its speakers: Kholo has 3y words for the term "slave" and only two for "work".

## Kuru
Kuru is the racial language of the cannibalistic kuru who make their home in the Shackles.

## Munavri
Munavri is the racial language of the albino munavri who make their home deep beneath the continent of Arcadia.

## Nagaji
The hissing Nagaji language is spoken almost exclusively by the inhabitants of Nagajor, specifically the Nagaji. The Nagaji tongue has been heavily influenced by the Naga over the centuries, and even when translated possesses various terms considered strange by non-native speakers.

## Orcish
Much like the folk who speak it, Orc, or Orcish, is a harsh and violent language, full of sharp delivery and hard consonants. It uses the Dwarven alphabet, and is spoken as a majority language only in the Hold of Belkzen.

## Plantspeech
Many sentient plants manage to communicate with other plants through a 'language' that is equivalent to a continuous speak with plants spell, called plantspeech. Sometimes, this plantspeech is only effective for communication with plants of the same species.

## Ratfolk
Ratfolk have their own language, sometimes also referred to as the Ysoki language.

## Rougarou
Rougarous are shapechanging wolf-headed humanoids, though emphatically not a type of werecreature. Usually able to speak Common to those outside their community, rougarous use their own racial language, also called Rougarou, to communicate amongst themselves.

## Sedacthy (Sahuagin)
The language of sedacthys is sometimes spoken by merfolk and azarketis.

## Samsaran
Even though the Samsaran language is primarily spoken in the mountainous Tian Xia nation of Zi Ha, it is also the racial tongue of the samsaran people, and a secondary language of the kitsune, nagaji, and wayang peoples.

## Sasquatch
Sasquatch is the name of the language spoken by the simian species of humanoid called sasquatch or, sometimes, "bigfoot". As well as more normal vocal words, the language is supplemented by howls and "knocking" sounds. The latter are produced when a sasquatch bangs a tree or rock with an implement. This complex language sounds similar to the normal sounds in a forest and thus aids in protecting the privacy of the species.

## Senzar
Senzar is the truly ancient language of the spirits of Tian Xia, and spoken most frequently by the kami of the Forest of Spirits as well as the inhabitants of the Wall of Heaven Mountains. Scholars believe that it may be the root language of all human tongues on the continent, as many words associated with the spirit world or dragons have Senzar roots. Senzar is also spoken natively by the kitsune, and as a secondary language by the nagaji, samsarans, and wayang. Although the Fey language is known in Tian Xia, most creatures that one would expect to speak it, instead speak Senzar.

## Shoony
Shoonies have their own language, also called Shoony.

## Sign Languages
Several groups use sign and gesture languages to communicate.

### Kasthezvi Sign Language
Kasthezvis communicate in a sign language involving contortions and jerking limbs.

### Sakvroth
While primarily spoken, the Darklands language of Sakvroth also includes a sign language typically employed by creatures who wish to communicate without being overheard. It is known to be used by the drow, although it is growing in popularity across the Inner Sea region and other creatures may have alternate versions.

## Sphinx
Sphinx is spoken by the guardians of Osirion. The ability to speak this language is needed to become a living monolith.

## Strix
The language of the winged Strix people of Cheliax is a pidgin of Azlanti and Infernal. The language sounds to human ears more like an eagle screeching than a form of humanoid communication. The strix refer to their own race as itarii in their own language.

## Syrinx
Syrinxes are an owl-like humanoid resident on the continent of Arcadia that have their own language also called Syrinx.

## Tengu
The language of the tengu, which may be found in a number of dialects. The language is also spoken by Yamabushi tengu: oni that resemble tengu.

## Thriae
Thriae is the language spoken by the female bee creatures of the same name.

## Tripkee
Tripkees are humanoids who resemble tree frogs. Many speak Common tongues such as Taldane, but amongst their own kind they speak their own language called Tripkee. The Tripkee language is spoken widely in the Valashmai Jungle, the home of a large tripkee community, and in the neighboring nation of Valash Raj.

## Vanaran
Vanaran is the racial language of the forest-dwelling, simian humanoids known as vanara.

## Vishkanya
The same word, Vishkanya, is used for the name and the racial language of the dark-skinned humanoids, who are famous for their ability with poison.

## Wayang
The wayang's racial language is spoken in Tian Xia most commonly in the Wandering Isles.

## Wildsong
Wildsong, also known as Druidic, has been guarded so vigilantly by the druids of Golarion that it remains a secret language to this day. Speakers of Elven or Fey may be able to discern a few individual words here and there, but even they remain baffled without a greater context to place them in.

Wildsong is a tonal language employing melody and more closely resembles animal calls than speech, while its script includes natural features such as the fractal structures of plants, shells, and snowflakes. Druids are forbidden from teaching it to non-druids.

## Common
Common is a relative term used to denote the most prevalent human language spoken in a particular region. For instance, Taldane is the most widely spoken language on the continents of Avistan and northern and eastern Garund and so is referred to as Common in the Inner Sea region. In western Garund, however, the Mwangi language is used as the common tongue. 

# Darklands Languages
## Aklo
Aklo is a language found in remote pockets of the Darklands, and is thought to have otherworldly origins. It is believed to be the language of the serpentfolk but is also spoken by creatures as diverse as linnorms, neothelids, alghollthus, shoggoths, and gibbering mouthers. Mortals struggle to learn and speak it. It shares certain similarities with Gnome and Orvian. Aklo is also spoken by strange eldritch entities and certain ancient powers from the First World.

## Caligni
This secretive language, also known as Dark Folk, is spoken exclusively by various forms of calignis, such as caligni dancers, caligni creepers, and caligni stalkers.

## Canto
Canto is a primitive language found in the Darklands. Communication is achieved though percussive hits on body parts, weapons, or cavern walls, and is designed to travel long distances through echoing tunnels.

## Flail Snail
Flail Snail is the language of the enormous snails resident in the Darklands. It consists of sign language and slime writing: the flail snails cannot speak. The language has been studied and the findings published by the Pathfinder Society.

## Gug
Gug is a language of the Darklands spoken by the grotesque giants known as the gug. It consists of little other than gurgling and grunting.

## Necril
Necril is the muttering language spoken by the ravenous ghouls of the Darklands and by followers of the Whispering Way, but is also spoken by many intelligent undead throughout Golarion and by those who hunt them. It is a mixture of ancient and modern Osiriani, Aklo and Sakvroth, focusing on terms and concepts central to the ghouls' existence and morbid culture.

## Orvian
Orvian is a truly ancient language still spoken in the Orvian Vaults of the Darklands. Some believe that it is descended from the language of the fabled Vault Keepers themselves. It seems to be heavily influenced by both Aklo and Terran.

## Sakvroth
Sakvroth, also known as Undercommon, is the most widely spoken language of the Darklands. It evolved from Elven and was repurposed by the drow over the centuries. It incorporated words from Orvian, and eventually mutated so far that it was mutually unintelligible with its mother tongues.

Sakvroth is also a secret sign language employed in the Darklands by creatures who wish to communicate without being overheard. It is known to be used by the drow, although it is growing in popularity across the Inner Sea region and other creatures may have alternate versions.

## Vegepygmy
Vegepygmy is a language incorporating thumps and slaps mixed with smells used by vegepygmies and other plant creatures.

# Languages of the Great Beyond

## Chthonian
Some believe that Chthonian, also known as Abyssal, was the first language developed by the inhabitants of the Outer Sphere. Given the incredible rate of change within the tongue, this is very difficult to prove. Although it is the native language of the demons of the Outer Rifts, it is also spoken by many devils, daemons, or others who have frequent dealings with races of the lower realms. 

## Cyrunian
A language spoken by witchwyrds.

## Daemonic
Daemonic is the language spoken primarily by daemons of Abaddon.

## D'ziriak
The d'ziriak are insect-like natives of the Netherworld who communicate using a language of their own also called D'ziriak. The language sounds quite simply like insect noises: a buzzing and a chittering noise. Fortunately, the creatures can communicate with other races using telepathy.

## Diabolic
Spoken predominantly in Hell and by those who traffic with it, the Diabolic language, also known as Infernal, is a concise language which requires precise speech. It contains many homophones in its vocabulary, leading to great confusion among novice speakers, as similar-sounding words can have widely varying meaning.

## Empyrean
The Empyrean language, also known as Celestial, is spoken by all benevolent races of the Outer Sphere. It shares aspects of its structure with both Fey and Draconic, with few voiced consonants and lightly voiced vowels.

## First Speech or Fey-common
Almost all creatures in the First World that can speak do so in the First World's ubiquitous, but unnamed, tongue. Outsiders have dubbed this common language as "First Speech" or "Fey-common". The language is similar to both Fey and Aklo to such an extent that those fluent in either language can generally understand First Speech as well, so First Speech may have been the root of both of those languages.

## Jandelayan
Jandelayan is the supposed language spoken by the inhabitants of the mythical realm of Jandelay. The only creature known to have ever spoken it is the one most closely related to that place: the Oliphaunt of Jandelay.

## Jyoti
Jyoti is the language spoken by creatures who inhabit Creation's Forge and is named after the jyoti, winged creatures native to the plane.

## Muan
Muan is the language of the Plane of Wood's inhabitants and is composed of percussive and melodic sounds that resemble musical instruments. Its script is often written on plant-based media such as ephemeral papyrus or durable hardwoods and resembles sheet music in its notation of tone and tempo.

## Petran
Petran, also known as Terran, is the language of the Plane of Earth and an extremely slow language not meant to be rushed. The Plane of Earth's oldest earth elementals speak a version of Petran that is so ancient it is incomprehensible to any others, including native Petran speakers. It is believed this form of the language is that spoken when the Plane of Earth formed, and maybe from even before that time.

## Protean
Protean is the ever-changing language of the proteans, who are natives of the Maelstrom. The language's mutability makes it very difficult to record or study in either its hissed vocalized form or its written form.

## Pyric
The language of the Elemental Plane of Fire, Pyric—also known as Ignan—is a quick, percussive language, said to emulate the popping of a fire, roar of a blazing inferno, or the hiss of smoke. Mortals find it a difficult language to speak without assistance, such as from enchanted candles that reproduce more difficult sounds to accompany more achievable vocalizations. Pyric writing often involves melted candle wax and singed holes on flammable paper.

## Requian
Requian is a melodic language spoken slowly in the courts of the Boneyard, and is the primary written language in the Boneyard's facilities. On Golarion, it is used in Pharasmin writings.

## Shadowtongue
Shadowtongue is the common language of the Netherworld. It is a sibilant language of quiet hisses and whispered words. Many words are pronounced with a delicate intake of breath. Non-speakers who hear it often remark that it sounds like it is being spoken backwards.

## Shae
Shae is the language spoken by and named after the mysterious humanoids of the Netherworld called shae.

## Sign languages
Several groups use sign and gesture languages to communicate.

### Bonewrought willow sign language
Bonewrought willows of the Boneyard are intelligent enough to have learned a sign language from psychopomps, and have since developed and taught it to other bonewrought willows.

### Ib
Ib is the language used by beings of Ib. These creatures are unable to speak in the fashion understood by, say, humans but their language uses facial expressions and hand movements to communicate. They can also learn and understand other species' languages.

## Sussuran
Sussuran, also known as Auran, is a soft-spoken, breathy language which shares a similar grammar with the other elemental languages. It is primarily spoken by those of the Elemental Plane of Air. It is sometimes referred to as the "tongue of the heavens".

## Talican
Talican is a percussive language composed of struck metal pangs, such as bells, steel drums, and scraped steel. Many non-metallic beings find such sounds difficult or impossible to reproduce naturally and must use specialized metal tools to communicate. The written form is tactile and embossed or drilled as bubbles, ridges, and holes into sheets of metal, with additional magnetic context that is difficult for non-metallic beings to perceive.

## Thalassic
Thalassic, also known as Aquan, is a language from the Plane of Water. It grew from a proto-elemental language which was the progenitor of all elemental languages. Much of its vocabulary is taken up with water-related terms. It is a guttural language with many long syllables made up of dense, throaty sounds, with affixes and inflections providing subtle shifts in meaning. It is sometimes known as the "tongue of the sea."

## Truespeech
While not a language per-se, truespeech is a magical form of communication possessed by angels, archons, and azatas, which allows them to speak with any creature that possesses a language. Mortals are not known to be capable of using truespeech, although on very rare occasions, empyreal lords have been known to bestow this power on worthy paladins in their service. Truespeech is also spoken by the undead personification of death known as the Grim Reapers, and the divine servitor race of Abadar's called the orsheval.

## Utopian
Utopian is the language of Axis, aeons, inevitables, and axiomites. Aeons demonstrated to axiomites after the Convergence that the language is a combination of aeon principles and formulaic mathematical expression.

# Dead Languages
Languages are always undergoing changes, modified by time or distance. Over centuries, some transform to such a degree that they can be said to be a separate, distinct language, while others are wiped out with their speakers in the blink of an eye by catastrophic events. A language is considered truly dead if it no longer has a stable, living population of native speakers, even if written records of it still exist, scholars still study it, and certain immortal or undead individuals still speak it.

## Ancient Osiriani
The archaic root language of northern Garund, Ancient Osiriani came into being over 8,000 years ago at the dawn of the Age of Destiny. Though different from modern-day Osiriani, it is still decipherable to speakers of the modern language. It has more complex pictograms than its modern counterpart, although there are not nearly as many words. Words and symbols in Ancient Osiriani can also have many more meanings than the modern language. Legend holds that Thoth, the Lord of Divine Words and member of the Osirian pantheon, invented Osirian hieroglyphs.

More than 10,000 Osirian hieroglyphs have been identified from all ages of the language's history. The glyphs' meanings have shifted over time, and some carvings use a code to foil thieves, or use symbols to represent sounds rather than ideas.3

## Azlanti (Ancient Azlanti)
Even though the language of the kingdom of Azlant has not been spoken by a large group of people for millennia, its linguistic legacy is carried on in such languages as Taldane, Mwangi, Hallit, and Varisian. The elves of the Mordant Spire speak it to this day and refuse to talk to anyone in anything but this ancient language. They act as guardians of the tongue, just as they oversee the last remnants of the ancient continent above the waves. Phonemes from spoken Azlanti do not appear in modern Inner Sea languages.

## Jistka
The language of the Jistka Imperium that stretched across northwestern Garund and southwestern Avistan during the Age of Anguish and into the Age of Destiny, Jistka is remembered for forming the basis of the alphabets of many human languages. Skald, Taldane, and Varisian have numerous letters from the Jistka alphabet, and the Jistka numerals (where I is 1, V is 5, etc.) are still used by scholars and royalty for their most formal documents.

## Shory
The language of the Shory Empire was distinct and used runes for its written form. Sometimes Sussuran runes supplemented the written language. The language is extinct today.

## Tekritanin
This language (pronounced tek-rih-TAN-in) evolved with the founding of the Tekritanin League during the early millennia of the Age of Destiny, combining elements of many of the tribal languages spoken at that time in northern Garund. Many modern languages can trace elements back to Tekritanin, especially words concerning heat, desert, or governance. When spoken, it features pointed consonants and clipped pronunciation.
