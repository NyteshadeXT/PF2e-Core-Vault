# Life-Giving Form  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[focus]][[healing]][[light]][[manipulate]][[oracle]][[vitality]]

**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to void damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 vitality damage.

You can touch a living creature with an [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action to restore 6d8 vitality healing Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to _life-giving form_'s healing for 1 minute. This is a vitality healing effect. You can't heal yourself with _life-giving form_. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 + 0 vitality damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.

You can [[Actions/Dismiss|Dismiss]] this spell.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the Hit Points restored with an Interact action by 1d8, the vitality damage by 1, and the resistance and weakness by 1.
