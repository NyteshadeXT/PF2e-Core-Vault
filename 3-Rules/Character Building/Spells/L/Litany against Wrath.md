# Litany against Wrath  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[Holy]][[litany]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature that isn&#x27;t holy
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 round
* * * 
Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking creatures that aren't unholy. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.

**Failure** Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]]. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
