Divine grace ensure that nothing can keep you prisoner or hold you back. You immediately escape from every magical effect that has you [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] or [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] unless the effect is of a higher level than your unimpeded stride spell. You then Stride. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and any circumstance or status penalties to your Speed.
