# Tree of Seasons  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[plant]][[wood]]
**Traditions** [[primal]]
**Range** 60 feet
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You cause a Small tree to instantly sprout in an unoccupied space on the ground. Four seedpods grow from the tree, each filled with the magic of a different one of the four seasons. A creature can Interact to pluck one of the pods, and can then either throw it up to 30 feet as part of the same action or do so with a separate Interact action later. When thrown, a pod explodes in a 5-foot burst, dealing 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. The damage type depends on the season of the pod: electricity for spring, fire for summer, poison for autumn, or cold for winter. When the spell ends, the tree withers away and any remaining pods rot, leaving behind non-magical seeds.

6d6 cold

6d6 electricity

6d6 fire

6d6 poison

**Heightened (+1)** The burst's damage increases by 1d6.
