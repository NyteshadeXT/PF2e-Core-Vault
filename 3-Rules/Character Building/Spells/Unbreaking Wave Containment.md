You wrap enemies in four strands of water. When you cast the spell, make a spell attack roll against the targets. On a success, they're [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the spell ends or they [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]; on a critical success, they're also [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] until the spell ends or they Escape. Each target that's immobilized or restrained also takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage from the constricting waves, with a basic Fortitude save. The first time each subsequent round when you sustain the Spell, if all the targets aren't immobilized or restrained, make a spell attack roll against any targets who are free but remain within range, with the same effects as when you cast the spell, immobilizing or restraining them depending on your spell attack roll. Creatures who are immobilized or restrained take 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save.
