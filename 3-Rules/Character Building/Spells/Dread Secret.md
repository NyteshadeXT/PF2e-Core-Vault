# Dread Secret  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cursebound]][[emotion]][[fear]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[oracle]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** up to 6 creatures
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** until the start of your next turn
* * * 
You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.

**Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]] from the revelation of its dread secret.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]].
