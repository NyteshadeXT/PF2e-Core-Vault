You utter a curse that a creature will meet a certain end-a death by freezing, stabbing, or another means you devise. Choose one type of damage from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, slashing, or sonic. The effect is based on the target's Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target gains weakness 2 to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute. If the creature is reduced to 0 HP by the chosen damage and its level is 7 or less, it dies.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
