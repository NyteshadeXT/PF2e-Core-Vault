# Object Memory  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 1
### [[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Targets** 1 weapon or tool
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
By touching an object, you draw forth the experience of those who created and used it.

If you touch a weapon, your proficiency rank with that weapon temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher).

If you touch a tool, your proficiency rank with the next skill check you attempt with that tool (such as a Crafting check with a blacksmith's hammer) within the spell's duration temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). This spell has no benefit for activities that take longer than a minute to complete.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** Your proficiency rank increases to expert instead of trained.
