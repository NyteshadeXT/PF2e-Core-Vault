# Ki Rush  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[monk]]

* * * 
Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order).

You gain the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn.
