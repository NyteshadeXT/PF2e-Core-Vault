# Noxious Vapors  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[poison]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Area** 10-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
**Duration** 1 round
* * * 
You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]]. All creatures in the area become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the smoke become Concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
