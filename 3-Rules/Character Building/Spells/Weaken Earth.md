# Weaken Earth  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[concentrate]][[earth]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature, unattended object, or hazard or structure made of stone or earth
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You weaken the bonds that hold earth and stone together. If your target has Hardness, you can affect one contiguous object, up to a 5-foot cube, or one creature, decreasing the Hardness by 5, to a minimum of 0. If the target lacks Hardness, it gains weakness 3 to physical damage. A target with a Fortitude modifier can attempt a Fortitude saving throw, negating the effect on a success.

**Heightened (+2)** Hardness decreases by 5, the size of a contiguous object increases by one 5-foot cube, and the weakness increases by 3.
