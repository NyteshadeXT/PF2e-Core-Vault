# Unspeakable Shadow  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 9
### [[concentrate]][[death]][[emotion]][[fear]][[illusion]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[shadow]][[visual]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the frightened condition from _unspeakable shadow_ must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the fleeing condition).

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]].

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]]. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 4]] and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.
