# Litany against Sloth  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[litany]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature that isn&#x27;t holy
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 round
* * * 
Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target can't use reactions.

**Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]].

**Critical Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]].
