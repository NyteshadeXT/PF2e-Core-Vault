# Timber  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[wood]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Area** 15-foot line
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
* * * 
You create a small dead tree in your space that falls over on anyone in its path, then immediately decomposes. Any creature in the area takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked for a loop, making it [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d4.
