# Heinous Future  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[curse]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[prediction]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
* * * 
You hold up a fractured mirror to the target, and in that mirror it sees a thing that may yet come to passâ€”a ghastly foretelling that the target instinctively knows is eerily possible. It's not a guaranteed thing, just a dreadful possibility, but it haunts the target's thoughts all the same.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and stupefied 1 until it next gets eight hours of rest.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]], decreasing these conditions by 1 for each eight hours of rest it gets.
