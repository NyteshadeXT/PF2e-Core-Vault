# Spellwrack  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[concentrate]][[curse]][[force]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
* * * 
You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from _spellwrack_, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.

**Failure** As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12 persistent force.
