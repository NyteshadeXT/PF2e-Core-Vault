# Blanket Of Stars  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[concentrate]][[illusion]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].

While outside under a starry night sky, you're also [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] and Dazzled until the end of its next turn.
