When you cast this spell, you place a failsafe deep within the life force of the target. You can sense when the target takes damage, provided you're within 1 mile of one another. A creature can be part of no more than one life connection simultaneously. When the spell is complete, you gain the [[Actions/Defend Life|Defend Life]] reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends.
