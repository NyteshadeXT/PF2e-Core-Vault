# Shroud of Night  `pf2:1`  
## Cantrip 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[darkness]][[hex]][[manipulate]][[witch]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
Your patron blankets the target's eyes in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. It treats bright light as dim light, and unless it has greater darkvision, all creatures are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to it.
