# Peaceful Rest  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 corpse
**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations
* * * 
The targeted corpse doesn't decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for example, [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]]), do not count the duration of _peaceful rest_ against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** The spell's duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast and requires a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp).
