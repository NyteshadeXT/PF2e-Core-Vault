# Day's Weight  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 3
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 living creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 1 for the duration.

**Critical Failure** The target is fatigued and [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for the duration. The fatigued condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
