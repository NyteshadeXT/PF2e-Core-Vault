# Nudge Fate  `pf2:1`  
## Cantrip 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[hex]][[witch]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
The barest spin of your patron's spool is enough to alter fate. When the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends.

If you cast nudge fate while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends
