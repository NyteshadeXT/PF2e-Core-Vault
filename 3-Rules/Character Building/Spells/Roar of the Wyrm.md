# Roar of the Wyrm  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [[auditory]][[cleric]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[mental]]

**Area** 30-foot emanation
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures.

The impressive roar grants you a [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Roar of the Wyrm|+2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks]] for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, _roar of the wyrm_ is a fear effect.

_Roar of the wyrm_ affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the dragon trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
