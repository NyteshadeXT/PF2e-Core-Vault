# Divine Decree  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 7
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[sanctified]][[spirit]]
**Traditions** [[divine]]
**Range** 40 feet
**Area** 40-foot emanation
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that harms those who oppose your ideals. You deal 7d10 spirit damage to your enemies in the area; each enemy must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. If you're on your home plane and the creature is not, the creature is sent back to its home plane. A creature of 10th level or lower must also succeed at a Will save or be [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 minute; if it critically fails, it dies (this is a death effect).

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10, and the level of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical failure increases by 2.
