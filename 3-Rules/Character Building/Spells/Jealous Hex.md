You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength ([[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]]); Dexterity ([[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]]); Constitution ([[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained]]); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ([[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied]]). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
