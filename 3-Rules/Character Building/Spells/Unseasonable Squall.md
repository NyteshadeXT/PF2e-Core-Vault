Each Medium or smaller creature in the area when you Cast the Spell or that moves into spell's area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the creature was Flying, it gets a critical failure instead.

**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet away from the center of the burst, is knocked Prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
