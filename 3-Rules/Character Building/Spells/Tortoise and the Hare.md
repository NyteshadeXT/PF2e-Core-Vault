# Tortoise and the Hare  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 foe, and either yourself or 1 ally
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The targets are unaffected.

**Success** The foe is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] for 1 round, and the other target is unaffected.

**Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 rounds and the other target is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.

**Critical Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 minutes and the other target is quickened for 1 minute. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
