With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed. You issue a command to the target, with the effects of the spell [[Spells/Command|Command]].If the target is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied]], or taking persistent damage, it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the save. Regardless of the result, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour
