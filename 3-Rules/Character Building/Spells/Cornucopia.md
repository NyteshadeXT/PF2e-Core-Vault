# Cornucopia  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[druid]][[focus]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[plant]][[vitality]]

**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
Vines twine into a wicker horn in your hands, and out spills a single fruit, nut, or similar small bit of produce. A creature who eats the produce with an Interact action regains 1d6+4 HP. The cornucopia, as well as any unconsumed pieces of fruit, wither away at the end of the duration.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The cornucopia produces an additional piece of food. A creature can consume any amount of food from the same casting with a single Interact action. Eating six pieces of produce from the cornucopia gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.

Consume all produce
