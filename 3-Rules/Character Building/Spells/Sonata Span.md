# Sonata Span  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[sonic]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]
**Area** 30-foot line
* * * 
By playing a brief tune on an instrument or in song, you cause the notes of the melody to physically manifest into a shimmering, translucent path. This path doesn't need to be over solid ground and can tilt up or down diagonally up to 45 degrees, but it must be a straight, 5-foot-wide line. It can support as many creatures as can physically fit on the bridge.
