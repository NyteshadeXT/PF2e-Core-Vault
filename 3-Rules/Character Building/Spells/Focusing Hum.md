# Focusing Hum  `pf2:1`  
## Spell 3
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Area** 15-foot emanation
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to Cast a Spell while stupefied for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a -2 penalty to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].
