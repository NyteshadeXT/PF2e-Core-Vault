# Temporary Tool   
## Spell 1
### [[exploration]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Duration** until used or 1 minute
* * * 
You conjure a temporary simple tool, such as a shovel or rope into your hands. It lasts until it is used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. The tool is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item.
