# Illuminate  `pf2:1`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[fire]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Area** 30-foot emanation
**Saving Throw**  reflex
* * * 
You light all non-magical light sources in the area that use fire to provide their lightâ€”such as candles, lamps, and sconces. You can choose to make the emanation smaller than its maximum, to any distance of your choice. If a light source is attended by an unwilling creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save to snuff the light out before it becomes noticeable.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The maximum area increases by 10 feet.
