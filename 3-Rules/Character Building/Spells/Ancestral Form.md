# Ancestral Form  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[oracle]]

**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You take the form of your ancestral spirits, becoming [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] and quasi-corporeal. You gain resistance 10 to all damage (except force and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), and this resistance is doubled against non-magical and precision damage.

You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed; when [[Actions/Fly|Flying]], moving upward isn't difficult terrain for you. You can't move through solid objects, but you can float through tiny gaps.

You can't Cast Spells (but you can [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain Spells]]), activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 5.
