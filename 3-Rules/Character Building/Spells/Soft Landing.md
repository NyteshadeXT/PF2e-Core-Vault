# Soft Landing  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 1 mile
**Area** 60-foot emanation
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You create a magical field that buoys any creature or object falling into the area, providing a harmless landing from any height. As you generally fall 1,500 feet per round, you can cast this spell while you are falling to ensure a safe landing, provided you can see your landing point and it's within range.
