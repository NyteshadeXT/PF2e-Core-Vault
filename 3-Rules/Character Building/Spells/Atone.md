# Atone   
## Ritual 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Cast** 1 day**Cost** rare incense and offerings worth a total value of 20 gp Ã— the target's level
**Primary Check** Nature or Religion (expert)
**Secondary Checks** Nature or Religion (whichever is used for the primary check)
**Range** 10 feet
**Targets** another creature of up to 8th level who is a worshipper of the same deity or philosophy as you
* * * 
You attempt to help a truly penitent creature atone for its misdeeds, typically actions anathema to your deity. If the creature isn't truly penitent, the outcome is always a critical failure. This ritual uses Nature if the target is a druid, and Religion in all other cases.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature receives absolution for its misdeeds, allowing it to regain standing with your deity. It regains any abilities it lost. Before the atonement is complete, the creature must perform a special quest or other task chosen by your deity, as befits its misdeeds. If completed during downtime, this task should take no less than 1 month. For 1 month, the target receives divine insight just before performing an act that would be anathema to your deity.

**Success** As critical success, but the creature gains no special insight regarding its subsequent actions.

**Failure** The creature does not receive absolution and must continue to meditate and redress its misdeeds. Any future _atone_ rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as much and gain a +4 circumstance bonus to primary and secondary checks.

**Critical Failure** The creature offends your deity and is permanently cast out from the faith. The creature can't rejoin your religion without a more direct intervention.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the maximum target level by 2 and the base cost by 20 gp.
