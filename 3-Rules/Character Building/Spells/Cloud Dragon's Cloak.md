# Cloud Dragon's Cloak  `pf2:r`  
## Spell 3
### [[3-Rules/Rule References/Air]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** the creature targeted by the attack
**Duration** 1 round
* * * 
**Trigger** You or an ally in range is targeted by a ranged attack.

* * *

A cloud of mist enshrouds the target, appearing much like the deflecting clouds created by cloud dragons. The target is treated as [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack (so normally the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 Flat check to target it) and all ranged attacks against it for the duration.
