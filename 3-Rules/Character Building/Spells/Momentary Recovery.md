# Momentary Recovery  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 7
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[teleportation]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 60 feet
* * * 
You instantly teleport yourself and any items you're wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range that you can see. If this teleportation would bring another creature with you-even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container-the spell is lost. After you vanish but before you arrive, you can take up to 2 actions (or the number of actions you spent to cast _momentary recovery_, if it was fewer than 2 actions). You can't target any other creatures or objects with anything during these actions and any effect with a duration that you create during these actions ends immediately when you arrive. After you arrive, you are [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn.
