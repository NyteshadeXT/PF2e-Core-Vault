# Unbreaking Wave Barrier  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[water]]

**Area** 5-foot emanation
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
You create a protective circle around yourself that repels your foes. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC. Any creature other than you within the area, or attempting to move into the area, must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; a creature needs to attempt the Fortitude saving throw only once each round. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave barrier_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 5 feet it would've been pushed. On subsequent rounds, the first time you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain]] this Spell each round, you can increase the radius of the barrier by 5 feet.
