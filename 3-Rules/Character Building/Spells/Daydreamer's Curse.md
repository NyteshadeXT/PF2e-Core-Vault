# Daydreamer's Curse  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[curse]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[misfortune]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You impose a curse upon the target that renders it easily distracted and unable to focus its thoughts on tasks that demand insight or discernment. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Survival check. If the target critically succeeds at a Perception check or skill check to perform an action with the concentrate trait, the target gets a success instead.

**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target treats the outcomes of all checks with the concentrate trait as one degree of success worse than the result it rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure).
