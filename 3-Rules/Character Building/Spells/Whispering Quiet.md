## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[sonic]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Area** 15-foot burst
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You suppress sound in an area, preventing anyone from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent those in the area from talking or Casting a Spell, but no creature more than 5 feet away can hear its voice without succeeding at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory or linguistic effects as well as communication. Other sounds created in the area are muffled to a similar volume unless that sound is created by an effect with the sonic trait
