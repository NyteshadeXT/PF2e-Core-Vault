# Wooden Double  `pf2:r`  
## Spell 3
### [[manipulate]][[wood]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
* * * 
**Trigger** You're critically hit by a damage-dealing effect or a Strike.

* * *

A wooden double appears out of nowhere and takes the blow in your place. Take a Step action. A wooden block of your size and roughly shaped like you appears in the space you left and absorbs the hit. This block has Hardness 5 and 20 Hit Points. If the wooden block is destroyed, you take any excess damage that the block didn't absorb. After taking the blow, the wooden block collapses into a pile of splinters and dust.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The block's Hit Points increase by 10.
