# Rune of Observation  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[wizard]]

**Range** 500 feet
**Duration** 1 hour
* * * 
You inscribe an invisible eye-shaped rune in the air, creating a sensor as [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]]. When created, this eye must be in your line of sight.

Each time the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations
