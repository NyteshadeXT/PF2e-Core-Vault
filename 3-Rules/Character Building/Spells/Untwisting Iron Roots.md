# Untwisting Iron Roots  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[earth]][[focus]]

**Area** 10-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
* * * 
You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
