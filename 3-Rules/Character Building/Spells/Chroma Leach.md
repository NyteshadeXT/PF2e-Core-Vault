# Chroma Leach  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 living creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]]. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]] (although magic such as [[Spells/Restoration|Restoration]] can reduce or remove these conditions).
