# Delusional Pride  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[mental]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You make the target overconfident, leading it to ascribe failure to external factors. The target attempts a Will save to determine the spell's duration and is temporarily immune for 24 hours regardless of the save's result.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The duration is 1 round. If the target fails at an attack roll or skill check, it takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls and skill checks until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it attempted the roll outside its turn). If the creature fails a second time while taking this penalty, the penalty increases to –2.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 10 minutes.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 24 hours.
