# Holy Light  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 3
### [[attack]][[concentrate]][[fire]][[holy]][[light]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
* * * 
You shine a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target has the unholy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.

**Success** The target takes full damage.

If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, holy light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against unholy creatures increases by 2d6.
