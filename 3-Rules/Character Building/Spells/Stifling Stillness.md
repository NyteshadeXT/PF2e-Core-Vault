# Stifling Stillness  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[air]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[poison]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Area** 20-foot burst
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You make all air in the target area unnaturally still and unyielding, creating a shimmering haze. The stagnant, heavy air becomes an area of difficult terrain. Creatures in the area that breathe air and aren't holding their breath must spend a single action on their turn straining to breathe the stagnant air; once they do, they still mostly breathe their own exhaled air, taking 3d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save) and becoming [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 3d6.
