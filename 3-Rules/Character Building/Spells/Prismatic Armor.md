You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light. It functions as [[Spells/Chromatic Armor|Chromatic Armor]] that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] rather than [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]].
