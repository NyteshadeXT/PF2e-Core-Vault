# Hero's Defiance  `pf2:0`  
## Focus 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[healing]][[vitality]]

* * * 
**Trigger** An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.

* * *

You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or [[Conditions/Dying 1|Dying]]. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use _hero's defiance_ again until you Refocus or the next time you prepare. _Hero's defiance_ cannot be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]].
