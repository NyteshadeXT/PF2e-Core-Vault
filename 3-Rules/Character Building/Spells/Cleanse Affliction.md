## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[healing]][[manipulate]]

**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 willing creature
* * * 
Gentle restorative magic pushes back the effects of toxins and more complex maladies. Choose an affliction on the target, such as a curse, disease, or poison. If it has advanced past stage one, reduce the stage by one. This reduction can be applied only once to a given case of an affliction, with the case ending when it's completely cured. Although the reduction can't occur again, heightened versions of this spell attempt to counteract with each casting.

* * *

**Heightened (3rd)** Attempt to counteract the affliction if it is a disease or poison.

**Heightened (4th)** Attempt to counteract the affliction if it is a curse, disease, or poison.
