# Nature's Enmity  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 9
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Area** 500-foot burst
**Targets** up to 5 creatures
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.

*   Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants and fungi.
*   Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 Flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.
*   The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 Flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.

The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
