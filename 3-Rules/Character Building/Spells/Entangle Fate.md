# Entangle Fate  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 2 to 4 creatures in range
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 3 rounds
* * * 
You cause a swirl of energy to entangle the fates of all caught within the blast. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature's fate becomes distorted, and momentary conflicting glimpses of the immediate future cause the creature to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn.

**Failure** As success, but the creature is off-guard for the duration of the spell. If more than one of the targets failed to resist this spell, the creature also becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for the duration of the spell as its fate and those of the other creatures continue to clash and strain against each other.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but any creature that becomes stupefied 1 for the duration of the spell also becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] for the spell's duration.
