# Draw Moisture  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[water]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[primal]]
**Range** 10 feet
**Targets** 1 object
* * * 
You draw water out of an object, possibly to clean up spills or quickly dry a soaked book or shirt. You draw up to a pint of water from the object; this dries objects of less than 1 Bulk. The water collects in a globule floating in your hand, which you can direct into a nearby container as part of Casting the Spell; otherwise, it splashes to the ground. Repeated applications of draw moisture can be used to dry larger objects, although doing so might take significant time. You can use this spell in especially humid environments to condense drinkable water from the air, though typically, you can't draw more than a few cups before depleting the ambient moisture.
