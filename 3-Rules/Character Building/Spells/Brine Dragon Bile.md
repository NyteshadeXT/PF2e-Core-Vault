## Spell 2
### [[acid]][[attack]][[concentrate]][[3-Rules/Rule References/Water]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** the creature that took damage

**Trigger** A creature within range takes damage from a slashing or piercing attack, or one that inflicts persistent bleed damage.

You spit a glob of caustic saltwater that stings the wounds of the creature. Make a ranged spell attack against the triggering creature's AC. On a hit, salt scours its open wound, dealing 2d6 persistent acid damage.
