## Focus 4
### [[cleric]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[mental]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Area** 15-foot emanation
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies.

Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.

[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Font of Serenity|Spell Effect: Font of Serenity]]

An ally can touch the font as an Interact action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one emotion effect affecting the ally of the ally's choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day. If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.

* * *

**Heightened (+4)** The bonus increases by 1.
