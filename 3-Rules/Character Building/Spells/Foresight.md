You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one _foresight_ spell in effect at a time. Casting _foresight_ again ends the previous _foresight_. While _foresight_ is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction: [[Actions/Foresight|Foresight]]
