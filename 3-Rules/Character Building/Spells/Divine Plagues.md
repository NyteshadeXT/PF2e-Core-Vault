Your deity sends wracking plagues. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. When you Cast the Spell, decide whether the disease inflicts the Clumsy, Enfeebled, or Stupefied condition.

**Divine Plague** (disease) **Level** 1

**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] (1 round)

**Stage 2** [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]], and Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 (1 round)

**Stage 3** Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 and the target can't recover from the condition until they are cured (1 day)

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 1.

**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 2.
