# Tangling Creepers  `pf2:3`  
## Spell 6
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[plant]][[wood]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 500 feet
**Area** 40-foot burst
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can Sustain the spell to make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
