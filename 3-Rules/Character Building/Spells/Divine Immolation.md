Divine flames scour creatures within the area. Creatures take 6d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage. The divine power within the flames scorches the spirit as well; a creature takes spirit damage instead of fire damage from divine immolation if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM).

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and double persistent damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 and persistent damage increases by 1d6.
