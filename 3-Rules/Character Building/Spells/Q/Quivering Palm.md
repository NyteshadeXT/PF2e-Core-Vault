# Quivering Palm  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[monk]]

**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** 1 month
* * * 
Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

If you cast quivering palm again, the effects of any quivering palm you had previously cast end.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]] and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 3]] and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by quivering palm.

**Critical Failure** The target dies.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
