# Jump  `pf2:1`  
## Spell 1
### [[manipulate]][[move]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
* * * 
Your legs surge with strength, ready to leap high and far. You jump 30 feet in any direction without touching the ground. You must land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of you, or else you fall after using your next action.

* * *

**Heightened (3rd)** The range becomes touch, the target changes to one touched creature, and the duration becomes 1 minute, allowing the target to jump as described whenever it takes the [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] action.
