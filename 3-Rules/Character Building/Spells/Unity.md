## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[fortune]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** each ally targeted by the triggering spell
* * * 
**Trigger** You and 1 or more allies within range are targeted by a spell or ability that allows a saving throw.

* * *

You put up a united defense. Each ally can use your saving throw modifier instead of its own against the triggering spell. Each ally decides individually which modifier to use.
