# Rip the Spirit  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`  
## Spell 5
### [[death]][[void]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 living creature
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
* * * 
You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes 5d6 void damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]] if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

`pf2:1` **(somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.

`pf2:2` **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is 10d6 void damage instead of 5d6.

`pf2:3` **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage increases by 1d6, or by 2d6 for the 2-action version.
