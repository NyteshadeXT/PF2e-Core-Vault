# Cascade Countermeasure  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[focus]][[magus]][[manipulate]]

**Duration** until the Arcane Cascade stance ends
* * * 
You quickly adjust your [[Actions/Arcane Cascade|Arcane Cascade]] to offer magical protection. You gain resistance 5 against damage from spells. As normal, using Arcane Cascade again means you've ended the stance, and the spell ends.

* * *

**Heightened (+3)** The resistance increases by 5.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
