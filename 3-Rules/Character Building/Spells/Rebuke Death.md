# Rebuke Death  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[vitality]]

**Area** 20-foot emanation
**Targets** 1 living creature per action spent to Cast this Spell
* * * 
You snatch creatures from the jaws of death, restoring them without the straing of a typical close call. You can spend 1 to 3 actions Casting this Spell, and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains 3d6 Hit Points. If the target had the [[Conditions/Dying 1|Dying]] condition, coming back from Dying due to this healing doesn't increase its [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded]] condition.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the healing by 1d6.
