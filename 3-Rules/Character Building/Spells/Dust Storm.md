# Dust Storm  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [[air]][[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[nonlethal]]

**Range** 120 feet
**Area** 20-foot burst
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The _dust storm_ obscures vision, with the effect of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]]. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must hold their breath, though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the _dust storm_ take 1d6 slashing damage. Creatures that have the water trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
