# Phantom Prison  `pf2:3`  
## Spell 3
### [[concentrate]][[illusion]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[visual]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 50 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You completely surround a Large or smaller creature in immobile illusory walls, trapping it inside a false prison it can't escape. No other creatures see or feel these walls, and the target can't see anything outside of the illusory walls. The target can attempt a Will save when the spell is cast, each time it attempts to interact with or escape the walls, and each time something from outside the walls affects the target. On a success, it disbelieves the illusion and the spell ends.

* * *

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures.
