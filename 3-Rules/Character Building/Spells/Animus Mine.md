## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[mental]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]

**Duration** 1 hour

You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. You can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell.

The first creature that uses a mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save.
