You create a melody distilled from pure grief, conveying the inevitable loss of everything your target cherishes, audible to only them. The target takes 10d6 mental damage depending on its Will save. A creature cursed by this spell can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses, for the duration noted in the degree of success.
