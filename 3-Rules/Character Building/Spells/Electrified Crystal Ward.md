# Electrified Crystal Ward  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 3
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[electricity]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Targets** 1 hinge or latch
* * * 
You create an [[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Electric Latch Rune|Electric Latch Rune]] hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard's listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous _electric latch rune_ is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The hazard's damage increases by 1d12.
