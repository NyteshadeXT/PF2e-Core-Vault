# Unfettered Movement  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature touched
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] an effect that has them [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher rank than the _unfettered movement_ spell.
