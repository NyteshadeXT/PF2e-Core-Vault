**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
* * * 
A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach.

On a success, you deal 2d4 fire damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
