    desc: "You inscribe minor runes of stasis, sing lullabies of entropy, or channel stabilizing elemental energies into freshly harvested monster parts. The affected items are warded against natural decomposition for 24 hours, maintaining their **Fresh** condition for the duration.\n\nThe ritual does not restore already degraded items, nor does it protect against magical corruption, contamination, or mishandling. Multiple uses of *Preserve Organic* on the same materials **do not stack**, but they can extend the preservation window if cast consecutively.\n\nThis ritual is commonly used by field alchemists, druids, and hunters operating far from established crafting halls."
