# Infectious Enthusiasm  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[manipulate]][[mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Duration** 1 round

With enchanted gusto, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies. You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, Will saves, or Charisma-based skill checks. During the spell's duration, an ally who observed you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.

Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on Charisma-based skills if the subject of the check observed you casting the spell.
