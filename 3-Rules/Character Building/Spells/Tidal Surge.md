### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[water]]

**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
You call forth a tremendous wave to move the target either in a body of water or on the ground. You move the target up to 10 feet in any direction along the ground or 20 feet through a body of water. An unwilling target can attempt a Fortitude save, and it avoids being moved if it succeeds.
