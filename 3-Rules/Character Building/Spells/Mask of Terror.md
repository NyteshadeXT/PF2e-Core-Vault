# Mask of Terror  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 7
### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[fear]][[illusion]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[visual]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]] before using its action.

**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]], and its action fails and is wasted.

* * *

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against _mask of terror_.
