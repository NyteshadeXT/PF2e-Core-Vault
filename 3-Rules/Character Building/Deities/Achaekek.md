# Achaekek

### 

**Category** deity; 




While Achaekek's divine genesis is debated among scholars, it's believed that he was created—either by the power of a singular deity or a group of them—to eradicate those who would steal a god's divinity, and he has since become the enforcer of divine punishment and patron of the Red Mantis assassins.

**Edicts** conduct assassinations, spread the Red Mantis's infamy, wield sawtooth sabers in combat

**Anathema** kill a rightful ruler, become fixated on petty matters such as others' gender or ancestry, abandon an assassination contract you agreed to pursue

**Areas of Concern** assassins, divine punishments, and the Red Mantis
