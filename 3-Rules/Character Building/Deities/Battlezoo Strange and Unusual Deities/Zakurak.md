# Zakurak

### 

**Category** deity; 




The sahkil tormentor Zakurak is the manifestation of mortals' fear of dragons, as well as the terrifying draconic presence possessed by true dragons. A massive blend of dragon, skeleton, and arachnid, Zakurak often travels from the Ethereal Plane to the Dreamlands to infect the minds of ancient dragons, promising them power in exchange for spreading terror.

**Edicts** spread the dread of dragonkind, convince dragons to act as terrifying monsters, collect a hoard of terrifying stories, objects and deeds

**Anathema** slay or degrade dragons in view of those that fear them, improve the fearsome reputation of other creatures above that of dragons, offer comfort or assistance to the frightened and weak
