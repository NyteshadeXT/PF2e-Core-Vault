# Acrobatics
Acrobatics measures your ability to perform tasks requiring coordination and grace. When you use the Escape basic action (page 416), you can use your Acrobatics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier. You can also use it for the basic actions Arrest a Fall (page 418) and Grab an Edge (page 418) instead of Reflex.

#### BALANCE  `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

**Requirements** You are in a square that contains a narrow surface, uneven ground, or another similar feature.

You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground, attempting an Acrobatics check against its Balance DC. You are off-guard while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.

- **- **Critical Success**** You move up to your Speed.
- **Success** You move up to your Speed, treating it as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).
- **Failure** You must remain stationary to keep your balance (wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.
- **Critical Failure** You fall and your turn ends.

> [!note]+ Sample Balance Tasks
> **Untrained** tangled roots, uneven cobblestones
> **Trained** wooden beam
> **Expert** deep, loose gravel
> **Master** tightrope, smooth sheet of ice
> **Legendary** razor’s edge, chunks of floor falling in midair

#### TUMBLE THROUGH  `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can Tumble Through using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.

 - **Success** You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
- **Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in. 

## Acrobatics Trained Actions
#### MANEUVER IN FLIGHT `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

**Requirements** You have a fly Speed.

You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

- **Success** You succeed at the maneuver.
- **Failure** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply can’t move or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were trying to fly against a strong wind).
- **Critical Failure** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.

> [!note]+ Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks
> Trained steep ascent or descent
> Expert fly against the wind
> Master reverse direction
> Legendary fly through gale force winds

#### SQUEEZE
[Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain (page 423) that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

- **- **Critical Success**** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
- **Success** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
- **Critical Failure** You become stuck in the tight space. While you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.

> [!note]+ Sample Squeeze Tasks
> Trained space barely fitting your shoulders
> Master space barely fitting your head

# Arcana
Arcana measures how much you know about arcane magic and creatures. Even if you’re untrained, you can Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about arcane theories; magic traditions; creatures of arcane significance (like constructs, beasts, and elementals); and the Astral Plane, Elemental Planes, and the Netherworld.

## Arcana Trained Actions
You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following general skill actions.
- Decipher Writing (page 228) about arcane theory.
- Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the arcane tradition.
- Learn a Spell (page 230) from the arcane tradition.

#### BORROW AN ARCANE SPELL
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") 

If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s arcane spellbook, arcane witch familiar, or the like. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell’s rank and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning the Spell (page 230).

- **Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.
- **Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can’t try to borrow this spell again until the next time you prepare spells.

# Athletics
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. Most Athletics actions let you move about the environment (Climb, High Jump, Long Jump, Swim) or control your opponent’s movement in combat (Grapple, Reposition, Shove, Trip, and Disarm).

Escape: When you use the Escape basic action (page 416), you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

#### CLIMB `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

**Requirements** You have two hands free.

You attempt an Athletics check to move a maximum distance of 5 feet up, down, or across an incline. You’re off-guard while climbing unless you have a climb Speed. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances; you might get an automatic - **Critical Success** on an incline that’s trivial to climb. If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet.

- **- **Critical Success**** You move along the incline, increasing the maximum distance by 5 feet.
- **Success** You move along the incline.
- **Critical Failure** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land prone.

> [!note]+ Sample Climb Tasks
> **Untrained** ladder, steep slope, low-branched tree
> **Trained** rigging, rope, typical tree
> **Expert** wall with small handholds and footholds
> **Master** ceiling with handholds and footholds, rock wall
> **Legendary** smooth surface

#### FORCE OPEN `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.

- **- **Critical Success**** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process.
- **Success** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, and it gains the broken condition. If it’s especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
- **Critical Failure** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.

> [!note]+ Sample Force Open Tasks
> **Untrained** fabric, flimsy glass
> **Trained** ice, sturdy glass 
> **Expert** flimsy wooden door, wooden portcullis
> **Master** sturdy wooden door, iron portcullis, metal bar
> **Legendary** stone or iron door

#### GRAPPLE `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

**Requirements** You have at least one free hand and your target is no more than one size larger than you.

You attempt to grab a creature or object with your free hand. Attempt an Athletics check against the target’s Fortitude DC. You can Grapple a target you already have grabbed or restrained without having a hand free.

- **Critical Success** Your target is restrained until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes (page 416).
- **Success** Your target is grabbed until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.
- **Failure** You fail to grab your target. If you already had the target grabbed or restrained using a Grapple, those conditions on the target end.
- **Critical Failure** If you already had the target grabbed or restrained, it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land prone.

#### HIGH JUMP `PF2:2`
You Stride, then attempt a DC 30 Athletics check to jump vertically. If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically fail. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.

- **Critical Success** You Leap up to 8 feet vertically and 10 feet horizontally.
- **Success** You Leap up to 5 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally.
- **Failure** You Leap normally.
- **Critical Failure** You fall prone in your space.

#### LONG JUMP `PF2:2`
You Stride, then attempt a DC 15 Athletics check to make a long jump in the direction you were Striding. If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check. The GM might increase or decrease this DC depending on the situation.

- **Success** You Leap a distance equal to your check result rounded down to the nearest 5 feet. You can’t jump farther than your land Speed.
- **Failure** You make a normal horizontal Leap.
- **Critical Failure** You make a normal horizontal Leap, then fall and land prone.

#### REPOSITION `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

**Requirements** You either have at least one hand free, or you’re grabbing or restraining the target. The target can’t be more than one size larger than you.

You muscle a creature or object around. Attempt an Athletics check against the target’s Fortitude DC.

- **Critical Success** You move the creature up to 10 feet. It must remain within your reach during this movement, and you can’t move it into or through obstacles.
- **Success** You move the target up to 5 feet. It must remain within your reach during this movement, and you can’t move it into or through obstacles.
- **Critical Failure** The target can move you up to 5 feet as though it successfully Repositioned you.

#### SHOVE `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. The target can’t be more than one size larger than you. You push a creature away from you. Attempt an Athletics check against your target’s Fortitude DC.

- **Critical Success** You push your target up to 10 feet away from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.
- **Success** You push your target back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.
- **Critical Failure** You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.

#### SWIM `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")  

You attempt an Athletics check to move a maximum distance of 10 feet through water. The GM determines the DC based on the turbulence or danger of the water; in most instances of calm water, you get an automatic critical success. If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum possible distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet.

If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. This doesn’t apply if your last action on your turn was to enter the water.

- **Critical Success** You move through the water, increasing the maximum distance by 5 feet.
- **Success** You move through the water.
- **Critical Failure** You make no progress. If you’re holding your breath (page 437), you lose 1 round of air. 

> [!note]+ Sample Swim Tasks
> **Untrained** lake or other still water
> **Trained** flowing water, like a river
> **Expert** swiftly flowing river
> **Master** stormy sea
> **Legendary** maelstrom, waterfall

#### TRIP `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. Your target can’t be more than one size larger than you.

You try to knock a creature to the ground. Attempt an Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.

- **Critical Success** The target falls, lands prone, and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
- **Success** The target falls and lands prone.
- **Critical Failure** You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.

## Athletics Trained Action
#### DISARM `PF2:1`
[Attack](rules/trait_reference/Attack.md "Combat Trait")  

**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. The target can’t be more than one size larger than you.

You try to knock an item out of a creature’s grasp. Attempt an Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.

- **Critical Success** You knock the item out of the target’s grasp. It falls to the ground in the target’s space.
- **Success** You weaken your target’s grasp on the item. Further attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds the item.
- **Critical Failure** You lose your balance and become off-guard until the start of your next turn.

# Crafting
You can use this skill to create and repair items. Even if you’re untrained, you can Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about alchemical reactions, the value of items, engineering, unusual materials, and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM determines which creatures this applies to, but it usually includes constructs.

#### REPAIR
[Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You are holding or wearing a repair toolkit (page 290).

You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with both hands. Roll a Crafting check. The GM sets the DC, but it’s usually about the same DC to Repair a given item as it is to Craft it in the first place. You can’t Repair a destroyed item.

- **Critical Success** You restore 10 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional 10 Hit Points per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (a total of 20 HP if you’re trained, 30 HP if you’re an expert, 40 HP if you’re a master, or 50 HP if you’re legendary).
- **Success** You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional 5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of 10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you’re an expert, 20 HP if you’re a master, or 25 HP if you’re legendary).
- **Critical Failure** You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the item’s Hardness to this damage.

## Crafting Trained Actions
You must be trained in Crafting to use it to Earn Income.
- Earn Income (page 228) by crafting goods for the market.

## CRAFT
[Downtime](rules/trait_reference/downtime.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

You can make an item from raw materials. You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items and the Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items.

To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
- The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn’t list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s 17th or higher, you must be legendary.
- The item must be common, or you must otherwise have access to it.
- You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield, or an alchemist’s lab to produce alchemical items.
- You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item’s Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials.

You attempt a Crafting check after you spend 2 days of work setting up, or 1 day if you have the item’s formula. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances.

If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item’s Price in materials to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item. This amount is determined using the Income Earned table (page 229), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level.

After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of Crafting appears in the sidebar below.

- **Critical Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting.
- **Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.
- **Failure** You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over.
- **Critical Failure** You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.

### Alchemical and Magical Items
If you want to Craft alchemical items or magic items, you need to select the skill feat for Alchemical Crafting (page 252) or Magical Crafting (page 258) in addition to being trained. Stat blocks and details of these items appear in GM Core, so consult with your GM.

> [!infobox]+
> # Crafting Example
> Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in Crafting. He has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the Magical Crafting feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides to craft a striking rune, a 4th-level item. The GM secretly chooses a DC of 19.
> 
> The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 1 day building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his Crafting check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At this point, Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp.
> 
> However, Ezren has 13 more days on his hands, so he decides to spend additional time to complete the item. Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert at Crafting, he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day spent. After spending 13 days working, he reduces the total cost to complete the item from 65 gp to 52 gp. He spends the remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the striking rune, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could have stayed home to keep working on the striking rune, eventually reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!) 
> 
> If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher, he’d have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d reduce the remaining amount by 2 gp per day (the amount for a 6th-level expert), lowering the amount needed to complete the item after 13 additional days of work to 39 gp.

##  IDENTIFY ALCHEMY
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You are holding or wearing an alchemist’s toolkit (page 287).

You can identify the nature of an alchemical item with 10 minutes of testing using your alchemist’s toolkit. If your attempt is interrupted in any way, you must start over.

- **Success** You identify the item and the means of activating it.
- **Failure** You fail to identify the item but can try again.
- **Critical Failure** You misidentify the item as another item of the GM’s choice.

# Deception
You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and other forms of subterfuge. Deception often has a drawback if you get found out, and it’s often best to be out of town by the time this happens.

#### CREATE A DIVERSION `PF2:1`
[Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait")

With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures’ attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.

Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you’re trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.

- **Success** You become hidden to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to Sneak away, as described on page 245.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth skill to Hide or Sneak (pages 244 and 245). If you Strike a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
- **Failure** You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.

#### IMPERSONATE
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on page 288), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.

In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the Seek action to attempt Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead.

If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.

- **Success** You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.
- **Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
- **Critical Failure** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.

#### LIE
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Linguistic](rules/trait_reference/linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.

At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

- **Success** The target believes your lie.
- **Failure** The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.

## Deception Trained Action
#### FEINT `PF2:1`
[Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait")

**Requirements** You are within melee reach of the target you attempt to Feint.

With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unpreparedfor your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against your target’s Perception DC.

- **Critical Success** You throw your enemy’s defenses against you entirely off. The target is off-guard against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.
- **Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
- **Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.

# Diplomacy
You influence others through negotiation and flattery, or find out information through friendly chats.

#### GATHER INFORMATION
[Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.

- **Success** You collect information about the individual or topic. The GM determines the specifics.
- **Critical Failure** You collect incorrect information about the individual or topic.

> [!note]+ Sample Gather Information Tasks
> **Untrained** talk of the town
> **Trained** common rumor
> **Expert** obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret
> **Master** well-guarded or esoteric information
> **Legendary** information known only to an incredibly select few, or only to extraordinary beings

#### MAKE AN IMPRESSION
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Linguistic](rules/trait_reference/linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait") 

With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt a Diplomacy check against the Will DC of one target. You can instead choose up to five targets if you take a –2 penalty. The GM might add other bonuses or penalties based on the situation. Any impression you make lasts for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise. See the Changing Attitudes sidebar for a summary of the attitude conditions.

- **Critical Success** The target’s attitude toward you improves by two steps.
- **Success** The target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
- **Critical Failure** The target’s attitude toward you decreases by one step.

#### REQUEST `PF2:1`
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Linguistic](rules/trait_reference/linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait") 

You can make a request of a creature that’s friendly or helpful to you. You must couch the request in terms that the target would accept given their current attitude toward you. The GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC would never agree to them.

- **Critical Success** The target agrees to your request without qualifications.
- **Success** The target agrees to your request, but they might demand added provisions or alterations to the request.
- **Failure** The target refuses the request, though they might propose an alternative that is less extreme.
- **Critical Failure** Not only does the target refuse the request, but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to the temerity of the request.

# Intimidation
You bend others to your will using threats. Unlike Deception or Diplomacy, Intimidation is typically a blunt instrument with little room for nuance or care.

#### COERCE
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Emotion](rules/trait_reference/emotion.md "Effect Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Linguistic](rules/trait_reference/linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait") 

With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least 1 minute of conversation with the creature. At the end of the conversation, attempt an Intimidation check against the target’s Will DC, modified by any circumstances the GM determines. (The attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized in the Changing Attitudes sidebar on page 239 and described in full in the Conditions Appendix, starting on page 442.)

- **Critical Success** The target gives you the information you seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they aren’t likely to harm the target in any way. The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes unfriendly (if it wasn’t already unfriendly or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate—at least in the short term.
- **Success** As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.
- **Failure** The target doesn’t do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.
- **Critical Failure** The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren’t already, and is temporarily immune to your Coercion for at least 1 week.

#### DEMORALIZE `PF2:1`
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Emotion](rules/trait_reference/emotion.md "Effect Trait") [Fear](rules/trait_reference/fear.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](rules/trait_reference/mental.md "Effect Trait")

With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put‑down, you can shake an enemy’s resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt an Intimidation check against that target’s Will DC. If the target doesn’t understand the language you are speaking, or you’re not speaking a language, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.

- **Critical Success** The target becomes frightened 2.
- **Success** The target becomes frightened 1.

# Lore 
You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore, for example.

Most backgrounds make you trained in a specific subcategory of the Lore skill. The GM determines what other subcategories they’ll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to take the place of another skill’s Recall Knowledge action. For instance, you couldn’t choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or choose Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or choose Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.

If you’re making a check and multiple subcategories of Lore could apply, or a non-Lore skill could apply, you can use whichever skill you prefer. If there’s any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.

Even if you’re untrained in Lore, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about the subject of the Lore skill’s subcategory.

## Lore Trained Action
You must be trained in Lore to use it to Earn Income.
- Earn Income (page 228) by using your knowledge to practice a trade.

# Medicine
You can patch up wounds and help people recover from diseases and poisons. Treat Wounds is especially useful, allowing your adventuring party to heal up between fights. It can be made more efficient with skill feats like Continual Recovery (page 254) and Ward Medic (page 265).

Even if you’re untrained in Medicine, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about diseases, injuries, poisons, and other ailments. You can use this to perform forensic examinations if you spend 10 minutes (or more, as determined by the GM) checking for evidence such as wound patterns. This is most useful when determining how a body was injured or killed.

#### ADMINISTER FIRST AID `PF2:2`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit (page 288).

You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying or bleeding. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which ailment you’re trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.
- Stabilize Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that has 0 Hit Points and the dying condition. The DC is equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).
- Stop Bleeding Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage (page 409). The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.

- **Success** If you’re trying to stabilize, the target loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying to stop bleeding, the target benefits from an assisted recovery (page 445) with the lowered DC for particularly appropriate help.
- **Critical Failure** If you were trying to stabilize, the target’s dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, the target immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.

## Medicine Trained Actions
#### TREAT DISEASE
[Downtime](rules/trait_reference/downtime.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit (page 288).

You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature. Attempt a Medicine check against the disease’s DC. After you attempt to Treat a Disease for a creature, you can’t try again until after that creature’s next save against the disease.

- **Critical Success** You grant the creature a +4 circumstance bonus to its next saving throw against the disease.
- **Success** You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to its next saving throw against the disease.
- **Critical Failure** Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2 circumstance penalty to its next save against the disease.

#### TREAT POISON `PF2:1`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit (page 288).

You treat a patient to prevent the spread of poison. Attempt a Medicine check against the poison’s DC. After you attempt to Treat a Poison for a creature, you can’t try again until after the next time that creature attempts a save against the poison..

- **Critical Success** You grant the creature a +4 circumstance bonus to its next saving throw against the poison.
- **Success** You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to its next saving throw against the poison.
- **Critical Failure** Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2 circumstance penalty to its next save against the poison.

#### TREAT WOUNDS
[Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Healing](rules/trait_reference/Healing.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit (page 288).

You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature (targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then temporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes). The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you’re an expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you’re a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you’re legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.

If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the target to grant additional healing. If you treat it for a total of 1 hour, double the Hit Points it regains from Treat Wounds.

The result of your Medicine check determines how many Hit Points the target regains.
- **Critical Success** The target regains 4d8 Hit Points and loses the wounded condition.
- **Success** The target regains 2d8 Hit Points, and loses the wounded condition.
- **Critical Failure** The target takes 1d8 damage.

# Nature
You know about the natural world, and you command and train animals and magical beasts. Even if you’re untrained in Nature, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge about fauna, flora, geography, weather, the environment, creatures of natural origin (like animals, beasts, fey, and plants), the First World, and the Elemental Planes.

#### COMMAND AN ANIMAL `PF2:1`
[Auditory](rules/trait_reference/Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait")

You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check against the animal’s Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if the animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a course of action it was predisposed toward, or you offer it a treat.

You automatically fail if the animal is hostile or unfriendly to you. If the animal is helpful to you, increase your degree of success by one step. You might be able to Command an Animal more easily with a feat like Ride (page 261). Most animals know the Drop Prone, Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a horse’s Gallop, you can Command the Animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many actions on Command an Animal as the activity’s number of actions. You can also spend multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform that number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance, you could spend 3 actions to Command an Animal to Stride three times or to Stride twice and the make a Strike.

- **Success** The animal does as you command on its next turn.
- **Failure** The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does nothing.
- **Critical Failure** The animal misbehaves or misunderstands, and it takes some other action determined by the GM.

## Nature Trained Actions
You must be trained in Nature to use it for the following general skill actions.
-  Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of theprimal tradition.
-  Learn a Spell (page 230) from the primal tradition.

# Occultism
You know a great deal about ancient philosophies, esoteric lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural creatures. Even if you’re untrained in Occultism, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about ancient mysteries; obscure philosophies; creatures of occult significance (like aberrations, spirits, and oozes); and esoteric planes like the Astral Plane, Creation’s Forge, the Ethereal Plane, the Netherworld, and the Void.

## Occultism Trained Actions
You must be trained in Occultism to use it for the following general skill actions.
• Decipher Writing (page 228) on occult topics, including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles, obscure philosophies, and incoherent ramblings.
• Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the occult tradition.
• Learn a Spell (page 230) from the occult tradition.

# Perception 
Perception measures your ability to be aware of your environment. Every creature has Perception, which works with and is limited by a creature’s senses. Whenever you need to attempt a check based on your awareness, you’ll attempt a Perception check. Your Perception uses your Wisdom modifier, so you’ll use the following formula when attempting a Perception check. 

> [!note]+ Call Out
> Perception check result = d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties 

Nearly all creatures are at least trained in Perception, so you will almost always add a proficiency bonus to your Perception modifier. You might add a circumstance bonus for advantageous situations or environments, and typically get status bonuses from spells or other magical effects. Items can also grant you a bonus to Perception, typically in a certain situation. For instance, a fine spyglass grants a +1 item bonus to Perception when attempting to see something a long distance away. Circumstance penalties to Perception occur when an environment or situation (such as fog) hampers your senses, while status penalties typically come from conditions, spells, and magic effects that foil the senses. You’ll rarely encounter item penalties or untyped penalties for Perception. 

Many abilities are compared to your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. Your Perception DC is 10 + your total Perception modifier. 

## Perception for Initiative 
Often, you’ll roll a Perception check to determine your order in initiative. When you do this, instead of comparing the result against a DC, everyone in the encounter will compare their results. The creature with the highest result acts first, the creature with the second-highest result goes second, and so on. Sometimes you may be called on to roll a skill check for initiative instead, but you’ll compare results just as if you had rolled Perception. The full rules for initiative are found in the rules for encounter mode on page 468.

# Performance
You are skilled at a form of performance, using your talents to impress a crowd or make a living.

## Basic Competence
Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don’t meet the demands of the art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant attribute. For example, if you’re dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write your speeches!

## Performance Traits
When you use an action that utilizes the Performance skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances, but the most common performance-based traits are listed below.

If you want to be particularly skilled with one type of performance, you can select the Virtuosic Performer skill feat (page 264). That feat breaks down some of the performance listed above into specific instrument types, and your GM might allow you to add your own type.

| Performance           | Additional Traits                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Act or perform comedy | Auditory, linguistic, and visual |
| Dance                 | Move and visual                  |
| Play an instrument    | Auditory and manipulate          |
| Orate or sing         | Auditory and linguistic          | 

#### PERFORM `PF2:1`
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait")

When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is most useful when you want to prove your capability or impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers, or even change their attitudes if the GM sees fit.

- **Critical Success** Your performance impresses the observers, and they’re likely to share stories of your ability.
- **Success** You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the quality of your performance.
- **Failure** Your performance falls flat.
- **Critical Failure** You demonstrate only incompetence.

> [!note]+ Sample Perform Tasks
> **Untrained** audience of commoners
> **Trained** audience of artisans
> **Expert** audience of merchants or minor nobles
> **Master** audience of high nobility or minor royalty
> **Legendary** audience of major royalty or otherworldly beings

## Performance Trained Action
You must be trained in Performance to use it to Earn Income.
- Earn Income (page 228) by staging a performance.

# Religion
The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to you. You also understand how magic works, though your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge. Even if you’re untrained in Religion, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about divine agents, the finer points of theology, obscure myths regarding a faith, and creatures of religious significance (like celestials, fiends, and undead), Creation’s Forge, the Void, and the Outer Sphere.

## Religion Trained Actions
You must be trained in Religion to use it for the following general skill actions.
- Decipher Writing (page 228) of a religious nature, including allegories, homilies, and proverbs.
- Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the divine tradition.
- Learn a Spell (page 230) from the divine tradition.

# Society
You understand the people and systems that make civilization run, and you know the historical events that make societies what they are today. Further, you can use that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal, and economic workings of settlements. Even if you’re untrained in Society, you can use it for the following general skill actions.
- Recall Knowledge (page 231) about local history, important personalities, legal institutions, societal structure, and humanoid cultures. The GM might allow Society to apply to other creatures that are major elements of society in your region, such as the draconic nobility in a kingdom of humans ruled by dragons.
- Subsist (page 232) in a settlement by finding shelter, scrounging, or begging for food.

## Society Trained Actions
You must be trained in Society to use it to Decipher Writing.
-  Decipher Writing (page 228) that’s a coded message, text written in an incomplete or archaic form, or in some cases, text in a language you don’t know.

#### CREATE FORGERY
[Downtime](rules/trait_reference/downtime.md "Action & Ability Trait")  [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

**Requirements** You provide the proper writing materials for your forgery.

You create a forged document, usually over the course of a day or a week. The GM rolls a secret DC 20 Society check. If you need to forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of that person’s handwriting. Otherwise, you need only to have seen a similar document, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to the check (the GM determines the bonus).

- **Success** The forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can’t notice the fake (but see Examining Forgeries).
- **Failure** The forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake, potentially allowing passive observers to detect it. Each time a passive observer sees the document, the GM compares your check result to the observer’s Perception DC or Society DC, whichever is higher. If your result doesn’t exceed a passive observer’s DC, that observer knows the document is a forgery.

# Stealth
You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip past foes, hide, or conceal an item.

#### CONCEAL AN OBJECT `PF2:1`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC (finding the object on success).

You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.

- **Success** The object remains undetected.
- **Failure** The searcher finds the object.

#### HIDE `PF2:1`
[Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into concealment to become hidden, rather than observed. The GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are concealed from. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you have standard cover (or +4 from greater cover).

**Success** If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or undetected by the creature, you retain that condition. If you successfully become hidden to a creature but then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease being hidden if you do anything except Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If a creature uses Seek to make you observed by it, you must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.

#### SNEAK `PF2:1`
[Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

You attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type; you must move at half that Speed.)

At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by at the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater cover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the +2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover) to your Stealth check. Because you’re moving, the bonus increase from Taking Cover doesn’t apply. You don’t get to roll against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither are concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against it. You automatically become observed by such a creature.

**Success** You’re undetected by the creature during your movement and remain undetected by the creature at the end of it. You become observed as soon as you do anything other than Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate loud noise, you become hidden instead of undetected. If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a result, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected by that creature again.
- **Failure** A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away, though you still remain unseen. You’re hidden from the creature throughout your movement and remain so.
- **Critical Failure** You’re spotted! You’re observed by the creature throughout your movement and remain so. If you’re invisible and were hidden from the creature, instead of being observed you’re hidden throughout your movement and remain so.

# Survival
You are adept at living in the wilderness, foraging for food and building shelter, and with training you discover the secrets of tracking and hiding your trail. Even if you’re untrained, you can still use Survival to Subsist.
- Subsist (page 232) in the wild by foraging for food and building shelter.

#### SENSE DIRECTION
[Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Secret](rules/trait_reference/secret.md "General Trait")

Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.

- **Critical Success** You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.
- **Success** You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.

> [!note]+ Sense Direction Tasks
> **Untrained** determine a cardinal direction using the sun
> **Trained** find an overgrown path in a forest
> **Expert** navigate a hedge maze
> **Master** navigate a byzantine labyrinth or relatively featureless desert
> **Legendary** navigate an ever-changing dream realm

## Survival Trained Actions
#### COVER TRACKS
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed, using the rules on page 438. You don’t need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait.

#### TRACK
[Concentrate](rules/trait_reference/concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Exploration](rules/trait_reference/exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Move](rules/trait_reference/move.md "Action & Ability Trait")

You follow tracks, moving at up to half your travel Speed, using the rules on page 438. After a successful check to Track, you can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour.

In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait, but you might need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.

You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking, once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the trail, the weather, and the type of ground.

- **Success** You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re already following.
- **Failure** You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
- **Critical Failure** You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.

> [!note]+ Sample Track Tasks
> **Untrained** the path of a large army following a road
> **Trained** relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear through the plains
> **Expert** a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks obscured by rainfall
> **Master** tracks obscured by winter snow, tracks of a mouse or smaller creature, tracks left on surfaces that can’t hold prints like bare rock
> **Legendary** old tracks through a windy desert’s sands, tracks obscured by a major blizzard or hurricane

# Thievery
You are trained in a particular set of skills favored by thieves and miscreants.

#### PALM AN OBJECT `PF2:1`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")
You pick up a small, unattended object and try not to be noticed. Roll a single Thievery check against the Perception DCs of all creatures who are currently observing you. You can typically only Palm Objects of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise depending on the situation.

- **Success** The creature doesn’t notice you Palming the Object.
- **Failure** The creature notices you Palming the Object.

#### STEAL `PF2:1`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

You try to take a small object from another creature without being noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object of negligible Bulk, and you automatically fail if the creature who has the object is in combat or on guard.

Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully Steal the object. The DC is usually the Perception DC of the creature wearing the object. It’s easiest to steal an object that is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). The GM might increase the DC if the object is protected or if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents). For instance, the DC is typically 5 higher if the object is in a pocket, held in a creature’s hand, or similarly protected.

You might also need to compare your Thievery check result against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person wearing the object. The GM might impose a circumstance penalty to the DCs of observers who are distracted.

- **Success** You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an observer doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.
- **Failure** The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can take the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt to take the item. The GM determines the response of any creature that notices your theft.

## Thievery Trained Actions
#### DISABLE A DEVICE `PF2:2`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. A thieves’ toolkit is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.

Your Thievery check result determines your progress. 
- **Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a device requiring more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.
- **Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.
- **Critical Failure** You trigger the device.

#### PICK A LOCK `PF2:2`
[Manipulate](rules/trait_reference/manipulate.md "General Trait")

Requirements You’re holding or wearing a thieves’ toolkit (page 292).

Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick (locks and their DCs are found on page 288). Locks of higher quality might require multiple successes to unlock. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you use improvised picks, which are treated as a shoddy toolkit.

- **Critical Success** You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering.
- **Success** You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave behind damage that indicates the lock was picked on close scrutiny.
- **Critical Failure** You break your toolkit and leave behind obvious damage. Fixing a broken toolkit requires using Crafting to Repair it or else swapping in replacement picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for an infiltrator thieves’ toolkit).
