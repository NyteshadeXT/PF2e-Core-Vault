# Monster Mage
Wizards study dusty tomes in their towers and sorcerers rely on the power they were born to running through their blood, but you forge a different path. You search the world for monsters and defeat them to learn their spells. If you can slay enough monsters, your collection might grow larger than anything those other spellcaster can imagine.

The basis for your magic is a magical process of creating tokens from slain foes to learn one of the spells they could cast. Each token stores a single spell, and as you collect more tokens, the versatility of your magic grows with your collection. Your tokens only work for you, and as long as they remain in your possession, they glow with a faint azure hue. Due to this fact, those who don't understand the process of becoming a monster mage who see the blue glow and think that is the source of the magic sometimes mistakenly call monster mages "azure mages," "cerulean mages," and other such titles.

No one is sure precisely where or when the study of monster magic began, but it's a highly personal journey. The basic principles require teaching, whether from a mentor or self-studied with the use of books, but beyond that, it's up to you to learn the magic that monsters can offer. A monster mage's path to power is not always linear. For every monster mage interested in growing in raw power through dangerous adventures, another monster mage disappears into the wilderness and methodically defeats weak monsters until they return with the knowledge of countless spells.

The monster mage archetype synergizes well with the system of crafting with monster parts, since you have a lot of incentive to hunt down monsters anyway, getting what you want doesn't reduce the value of your monster parts, and keeping track of the spells monsters know is useful both for you and for someone want to add a spell imbued property.

## Monster Tokens

As a monster mage, your collection of tokens is as personal and as vital as a wizard's spellbook or a witch's familiar, as you commune with the power of your tokens to prepare your spells. As such, your tokens can take as many different forms as there are customs and conventions among monster mages. If you're focused on the idea that the eyes are the pathways to the will, and to magic, you might preserve the eyes of various creatures inside amber to act as your tokens. Instead, if you were more interested in the way that creatures draw upon the ambient magic of the world around them through their outer bodies, you might create tokens out of scales, plates, feathers, bits of exoskeleton, tufts of hair, or skin.

Your customs when it comes to creating tokens are up to you. However, if multiple people in your group are playing monster mages, vestige hunters, or other characters who might be interested in exactly what pieces of a creature they are able to salvage, be sure to coordinate to make sure you won't block each other from creating tokens, vestiges, or other bits of gear from the same creature. For instance, if another player is playing a monster mage that uses a creature's eyes to make tokens, you probably shouldn't choose to use a creature's eyes as well, or something that includes the eyes like the entire intact head. In general, the more of the creature you are using, the more likely that it'll come into conflict, so keep that in mind when you make your decision. Ultimately, you can always have your character be flexible with their customs for creating tokens to work with your party's needs. The magic works just as well no matter what, and many monster mages, like Zara, mix and match tokens of various sorts.

## Monster Mage Dedication Feat 2

**Prerequisites** You must defeat a monster with an innate cantrip and preserve a piece to create your first token

* * *

You have completed the process to become a monster mage by defeating a monster and creating a token, a small magical receptacle created from a piece of the monster allowing you to store the monster's magic. Choose one of the innate cantrips from the monster you defeated for the prerequisite; you create a token from that monster's body which contains that cantrip, using the same tradition as the monster did. Write down the kind of monster, the spell, the tradition, and a quick description of the token's appearance. You cast spells by preparing them from your tokens, which you collect from the monsters you defeat using the Create Token activity. Your tokens only work for you, and you can't share spells with other spellcasters, even other monster mages, or use the Learn a Spell activity to learn more monster mage spells. You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare up to two cantrips each day from the spells in your tokens (though you only start with one initially until you defeat another monster with a different innate cantrip). You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the spells you can from your tokens regardless of their tradition, but you don't become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for other spells you cast. Your key spellcasting ability for monster mage archetype spells is Wisdom, and when you cast them they are monster mage spells cast from spell slots, not innate spells. You gain the Additional Lore skill feat, and must choose a Lore skill associated with a monster. You also gain the [[Create Token|Create Token]] activity.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the monster mage archetype.

## Basic Monster Mage Spellcasting Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Monster Mage Dedication

* * *

You gain a 1st-level spell slot, which you can use to prepare monster mage spells from your tokens. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level spell slot. At 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level spell slot. When you prepare a spell from a token, you can heighten the spell (or reduce its level if the creature's innate spell was heightened above the minimum level); you need not cast it at the same spell level as the creature did. You can prepare a spell from the same token multiple times if you want to cast the spell several times during the day.

## Taste of Their Own Medicine Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Monster Mage Dedication

* * *

Due to the sympathetic magic connecting you and your tokens, your spells are particular effective against the creatures whose token you used to cast them. Whenever you cast a monster mage spell against the exact same kind of creature whose token you used to prepare that spell, your target takes a -2 status penalty to their AC and saves against the spell. At the GM's discretion, if the creature is very similar but not the same (for instance, a lamia and a lamia matriarch might be similar enough, but not two creatures whose only thing they share in common is that they are both demons) the target might take a -1 status penalty to their AC and saves against the spell.

## Monster Breadth Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Basic Monster Mage Spellcasting

* * *

You can cast more monster mage spells each day. Increase the spell slots you gain from monster mage archetype feats by 1 for each spell level other than your two highest monster mage spell slots.

## Expert Monster Mage Spellcasting Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Basic Monster Mage Spellcasting

* * *

You become an expert in spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the spells you can from your tokens regardless of their tradition, but you don't become an expert in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for other spells you cast. You gain a 4th-level spell slot to cast monster mage spells. At 14th level, you gain a 5th-level spell slot, and at 16th level, you gain a 6th-level spell slot.

## Master Monster Mage Spellcasting Feat 18

**Prerequisites** Expert Monster Mage Spellcasting

* * *

You become a master in spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the spells you can from your tokens regardless of their tradition, but you don't become a master in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for other spells you cast. You gain a 7th-level spell slot to cast monster mage spells. At 20th level, you gain an 8th-level spell slot.
