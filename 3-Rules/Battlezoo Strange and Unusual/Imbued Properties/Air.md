AIR

EVOCATION

MAGICAL

**Type** Weapon

* * *

**Path** Magic; Choose when you first imbue the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or primal.

*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Spells/Gust of Wind|gust of wind]]_ once per day.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.

*   **10th** The weapon can cast _[[Spells/Air Walk|air walk]]_ once per day.

**Path** Might

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **6th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d4.
*   **8th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.
*   **12th** The additional slashing damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals slashing damage, this benefit only applies to the additional damage.
*   **14th** On a critical hit with the weapon, you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you.
*   **18th** The additional slashing damage increases to 1d8.
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional slashing damage, the target gains weakness 1 to air until the beginning of your next turn.

* * *

**Path** Technique

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent slashing damage as blades of wind surround and slash them; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional slashing damage from blades of wind; this additional damage has the air trait.
*   **8th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent slashing damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances (as does the damage from hazardous terrain caused by this imbued property's 16th level effect). Even if the main weapon deals slashing damage, this benefit only applies to the slashing damage from this imbued property.
*   **14th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While suffering from the persistent slashing damage, the surrounding blades of air damage the creature the more it moves, slashing at them each time they do. All terrain is hazardous terrain for them, dealing 2 slashing damage for each square through which they move (this includes the movement from being pushed by a critical hit). On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 10 feet away.
*   **18th** The persistent slashing damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** On a critical hit, you can push the target up to 20 feet away.
