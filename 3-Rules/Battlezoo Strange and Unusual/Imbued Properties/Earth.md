# Earth
EARTH

EVOCATION

MAGICAL

**Type** Weapon

**Parts** The monster must have the earth trait or an attack or spell with the earth trait.

* * *

**Effect** You imbue the weapon with churning earth.

* * *

**Path** Magic; Choose when you first imbue the weapon for the granted spells to be either arcane or primal.

*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _[[Spells/Scatter Scree|scatter scree]]_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up.
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _[[Spells/Pummeling Rubble|pummeling rubble]]_ once per day.
*   **6th** The weapon's _pummeling rubble_ heightens to 2nd level
*   **8th** The weapon can cast _[[Spells/Earthbind|earthbind]]_ once per day.
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional piercing damage from spikes of stone; this additional damage has the earth trait.
*   **12th** The weapon's _earthbind_ and _pummeling rubble_ heighten to 4th level and the weapon can cast _[[Spells/Mountain Resilience|stoneskin]]_ once per day.
*   **14th** The additional piercing damage increases to 1d4.
*   **16th** The weapon's _earthbind_, _pummeling rubble_, and _stoneskin_ heighten to 6th level.

* * *

**Path** Might

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional piercing damage from spikes of stone; this additional damage has the earth trait.
*   **6th** The additional piercing damage increases to 1d4.
*   **8th** The additional piercing damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the piercing rock shards attach the target's feet to the ground, forcing extra effort to break the rocks and move from its current space. As long as it was on the ground, its first 5 feet of movement are difficult terrain, typically preventing it from Stepping. This effect lasts until it moves or for 1 minute, whichever comes first.
*   **12th** The additional piercing damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals piercing damage, this benefit only applies to the additional damage.
*   **14th** On a critical hit, the rocks connecting the creature to the ground fragment into damaging shards when the creature moves. If the creature breaks the rocks connecting it to the ground by moving, it takes an additional 1d8 piercing damage, which has the earth trait. If the creature instead chooses to wait the effect out for 1 minute without moving, it doesn't take the additional damage.
*   **18th** The additional piercing damage increases to 1d8.
*   **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the additional piercing damage, the target gains weakness 1 to earth until the beginning of your next turn.

**Path** Technique

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent piercing damage as stone spikes grow and pierce them; this additional damage has the earth trait.
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional piercing damage from spikes of stone; this additional damage has the earth trait.
*   **8th** The persistent piercing damage on a hit increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the piercing rock shards attach the target's feet to the ground, forcing extra effort to move from its current space. As long as it was on the ground, its first 5 feet of movement are difficult terrain, typically preventing it from Stepping. This effect lasts until it moves or for 1 minute, whichever comes first.
*   **12th** The additional damage and persistent piercing damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances. Even if the main weapon deals piercing damage, this benefit only applies to the piercing damage from this imbued property.
*   **14th** The persistent piercing damage on a hit increases to 1d8.
*   **16th** While a target is suffering from the persistent piercing damage, the earth spikes growing on the target transform into an earthen shield that blocks their attacks against you. Whenever they hit you with a Strike, you gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) to that Strike with a value equal to the persistent piercing damage.
*   **18th** The persistent piercing damage on a hit increases to 1d10.
*   **20th** Foes suffering from the persistent piercing damage become very partially petrified in their extremities, making fine movements difficult. They are clumsy 1 as long as they have the persistent piercing damage.
