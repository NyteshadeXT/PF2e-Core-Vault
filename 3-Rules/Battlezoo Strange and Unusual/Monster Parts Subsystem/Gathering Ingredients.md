# Gathering Ingredients
The first step in upgrading weapons with monster parts is gathering suitable parts. After a battle, the PCs can spend 10 minutes to gather the monsters' parts (a PC can instead take their time to gain a greater value of parts, see [[undefined]]). The time it takes to gather normally does not depend on how big or numerous the monsters were, though the GM might determine that a battle with particularly enormous or numerous monsters require multiple 10 minute increments to gather all the parts. Gathering parts automatically succeeds without a check. Monster parts vary in Bulk based on the original monster, but they generally tend to be extremely bulky. While the Bulk is at the GM's discretion, typical Bulk values are light Bulk for the parts of a Small creature, 1 Bulk for Medium, 2 Bulk for Large, 4 Bulk for Huge, and 8 Bulk for Gargantuan. As such, it is usually a good idea for PCs to use the parts quickly to upgrade their items via refining and imbuing.

While many monster parts are gathered by harvesting them directly from monsters, most campaigns will include opponents that are not sources of parts (such as human foes). These foes might instead carry refined items that the PCs can break down for useful parts for their own equipment, or even unrefined monster parts. The PCs can keep track of monster parts by their value, as well as the monster that provided them (for instance, "12 gp of giant crab parts"). This represents a variety of parts from those creatures, and the PCs can split the value of parts as needed. For instance, if the PCs used 10 gp of those giant crab parts to refine a weapon, they would have 2 gp of giant crab parts remaining.

It's recommended that the PCs be allowed to allocate and spend monster parts shortly after earning them, to avoid needing to drag along bulky materials and keep track of a large list of parts from different creatures and values (see [[undefined]] for a discussion on how to allocate these quickly). As the GM, you determine the value of the monster parts the PCs find. To determine how much value in monsters parts, as well as other treasure, PCs should be earning over the course of a level, use the appropriate Party Treasure by Level table: Table 1A for the Light variant, Table 1B for the Hybrid variant, or Table 1C for the Full variant. These tables replace the Table 10-9: Party Treasure table of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook.

For GMs looking to select treasure for a single encounter, use the tables of monster parts per monster: [[undefined]], [[undefined]], or [[undefined]]. These tables work on the same encounter building assumptions used in the Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide Treasure by Encounter table. This means they provide approximately the right amount of monster parts for the level if the GM uses about 640 XP worth of monsters that grant monster parts, with the rest of the XP from hazards and achievements and the rest of the wealth from "Extra Treasure" (as indicated in the final column in the Gamemastery Guide's table) found in caches, treasure chests, and other such locations. The GM can supply some or all of the Extra Treasure in the form of monster parts given as rewards for the PCs' accomplishments. In the Full variant, if the GM wants to have more monster battles than normal for each level, she can just use 800 XP worth of monsters instead of giving Extra Treasure (with the rest of the XP from hazards and achievements).

GMs can also use the monster parts per monster table to adjust a prepublished adventure to use this system. Simply add the listed monster parts by level for each opponent, and then subtract the appropriate amount of other treasure elsewhere (just currency for Light, coin and half the permanent items for Hybrid, and everything for Full).

Because treasure doesn't vary at exactly the same rate as experience, it is possible that if your group's encounters are particularly skewed towards single opponents above the party's level or many weak opponents; these situations might wind up giving a value of monster parts that is above or below expectations. This is especially true with very low level monsters and with monsters levels 17 through 20; the values for low levels monsters have been adjusted slightly to reduce this effect. Because of these factors, the tables for monster parts over the course of an entire level ([[undefined]], [[undefined]], [[undefined]]) more accurately represent an appropriate amount of treasure than the monster parts value per monster tables (Tables 2A through 2C). However, the parts per monster tables are easier and more convenient to use when building encounters; GMs can use either or both sets of tables to suit their style of running games.

For example, a group of 4 level 10 PCs using the full variant just defeated a level 13 purple worm. According to [[undefined]], the GM should give out a total of 8,000 gp of monster parts for level 10 PCs, and the purple worm was worth 120 XP, representing a little over 1/5 of the total XP of monsters the party will face this level, so the GM decides to give the PCs 1,750 gp worth of monster parts. If the GM needed an answer quickly and hadn't planned out the treasure for the entire level, they could instead use [[undefined]], which says to give out 1,560 gp worth of monster parts since the monster was level 13.

# What Makes a Monster?

This system works no matter how you define a monster, but, in most cases, PC ancestries like humans, elves, or orcs aren't a source for parts, except among evil groups that might wear leather armor made of tanned human skin, and the like. Similarly, while killing an angel for parts would work following these rules, most groups would likely balk at murdering a being of pure good. When it comes to a diplomatic solution, an angel or other creature the PCs befriend might be willing to offer some shed feathers, scales, or so on to use in item crafting. The way magic works, an angel's feather freely given to a worthy ally after a quest might have as much potential for crafting as many feathers taken from the corpse of a murdered angel. Since the system only measures the value of the parts, not the volume, you are free to make the decisions that work for your situation.

# Trading Monster Parts

Monster parts typically arenâ€™t sold on the open market, and they sell for half of their listed value if selling them is possible. If a monster's parts are inappropriate for any item the entire party wants to refine or imbue, the GM might allow the PCs to trade their findings with other adventurers for parts they can use.

# Haunts and Hazards

PCs can also gather parts or residues from a hazard with a physical manifestation. You can use the value for a creature if it's a complex hazard, or 1/4 that value for a simple hazard.

# Gathering More from Monsters

Regardless of the variant your group is using, a PC with an appropriate Lore skill (such as Dragon Lore when gathering dragon parts) can spend downtime carefully foraging from a monster corpse to increase the value of scavenged parts, using Earn Income with a task level equal to the monster's level. On a critical failure, or once they have doubled the value of the monster parts, the PC has garnered everything they can from this monster's corpse. A PC particularly interested in this task can also take the [[3-Rules/Character Building/Feats/Battlezoo Bestiary - Feats/Monster Scavenger|Monster Scavenger]] skill feat.
