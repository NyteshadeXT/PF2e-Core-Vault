# Chimeric

Creatures with this trait possess potent biological or arcane properties that can be harvested through Chimeracrafting. Their bodies contain latent essence, reactive cores, or refined monster parts suitable for forging powerful gear. These monsters yield valuable materials when harvested with proper tools and techniques (see [[Chimeracrafting]] rules).
