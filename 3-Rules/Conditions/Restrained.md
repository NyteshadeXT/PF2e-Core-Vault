# Restrained
You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [[Off-Guard]] and [[Immobilized]] conditions, and you can't use any attack or manipulate actions except to attempt to [[Escape]] or [[3-Rules/Character Building/Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] your bonds. Restrained overrides [[Grabbed]].
