# Vestige Hunter
Adventurers of all stripes defeat and kill monsters as part of their quests and missions, but you've realized that most of them let their foes' remains go to waste. You retain vestiges of your fallen foes, trophies and mementos imbued with a bit of occult magic by the connection you shared during your battle to the death, and the cultural touchstones of myths of heroes and monsters. As you incorporate these vestiges into your gear, they grant you special benefits you can use to fight with the ferocity of your fallen foes.

Like the monster mage archetype, the vestige hunter archetype works well with the system of crafting with monster parts, since you were already hunting down monsters, and retaining a vestige doesn't limit the monster parts you can collect.

## Vestige Hunter or Shapeshifter?

While the vestige hunter archetype is themed around the idea of taking mementos from your slain foes and incorporating them into your gear to use them to create powerful effects, what if your character took a page from myths like the legend of Sigurd, who gained powers by bathing in the blood of the slain dragon Fafnir? You could instead choose to have your character absorb the vestiges into their own body and become less and less human, flavoring the new abilities as inherent shapeshifting rather than physical vestiges performing the attacks!

For example, instead of adding a tentacle to your gear when you gain Vestige's Constrict, you might gain the ability to shapeshift one of your arms into a tentacle in order to constrict your foe after grabbing it, or instead of building wings into your armor or clothing, you could shapeshift a set of wings. You could apply the shapeshifting effects all the time, or have them happen on the fly as you use the feats from Vestige Hunter Dedication.

## Vestige Hunter Dedication Feat 2

Vestige Hunter Dedication (Scent) or Vestige Hunter Dedication (Vision)

* * *

You have learned how to retain vestiges from your foes and incorporate them into your own gear, attaching pieces imbued with meaning from your most important battles. The first vestiges you added have enhanced your senses. Choose to either gain low-light vision and darkvision, or to gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vestige hunter archetype.

## Vestige's Senses Feat 4

Vestige's Senses (Scent) or Vestige's Senses (Vision)

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with low-light vision, darkvision, or scent, as appropriate

* * *

You incorporated a vestige from a monster with additional senses, granting you those you had not yet gained from your first vestiges. This often takes the form of the monster's eyes or snouts placed somewhere in your equipment. You gain either darkvision and low-light vision or imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, whichever you didn't choose for Vestige Hunter Dedication.

## Vestige's Fins Feat 4

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with a swim Speed that is either aquatic or amphibious

* * *

You subsumed a vestige from an aquatic monster, allowing you to swim or breathe underwater. This usually takes the form of a set of fins and gills built into armor. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed and you can breathe underwater.

## Vestige's Breath Feat 6

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with a breath weapon that deals acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, positive, slashing, or sonic damage in a cone or line

* * *

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You incorporated a vestige into your gear from a creature with a breath weapon, such as a dragon's head on your shield, and you can make it breathe on your foes. You deal 1d6 damage per level of a type of damage depending on the breath weapon of the monster you chose when you took this feat. The breath weapon affects either 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line, with a basic Reflex save based on your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

**Special** When you gain this feat, choose a monster with a breath weapon you've defeated and type of damage for the breath weapon from the list of damage types in the prerequisite, based on the monsters you've defeated and the vestiges you've collected. If the monster has a breath weapon that deals multiple qualifying damage types, choose one of them. The breath weapon's shape, cone or line, depends on the monster you chose. Once you choose a monster for the breath weapon, you can't change that choice without retraining this feat.

## Vestige's Constrict Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with Constrict or Greater Constrict

* * *

**Requirements** You have a foe Grabbed.

* * *

You grafted a vestige into your gear from a creature known for constricting its foes, often a tentacle, tendril, coil, or other constricting feature. The vestige instinctively crushes your grabbed foe. The foe takes damage equal to your level + your Strength modifier, with a basic Fortitude save, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

## Vestige's Opportunity Feat 8

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with Attack of Opportunity

* * *

**Requirements** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

You built a vestige into your weapons from a monster that knew how to take advantage of openings, typically a piece of the monster that it used to make unarmed attacks. The monster's parts twitch slightly during battles, and when a foe drops their guard, they attack. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.

## Vestige's Climb Feat 10

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with a climb Speed

* * *

You attached a vestige from a climbing monster to your gear, allowing you to climb. This might be a set of climbing claws, spinnerets, sticky pads, or various other climbing features. You gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed.

## Vestige's Ferocity Feat 12

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with ferocity

* * *

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed.

* * *

You incorporated a vestige from a creature with the ferocious tenacity to cling to life. It wasn't enough to protect the creature when you defeated it, but perhaps that ferocious life force will save you now in your time of need. You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your wounded condition increases by 1.

## Vestige's Grab Feat 14

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, defeat a monster with Grab or Improved Grab

* * *

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike, and either you have a hand free or your Strike used a grapple weapon.

* * *

You attached a vestige from a grabbing monster either to your weapons or near where you make your unarmed attacks, typically a piece of the monster that it used to grab foes. The vestige lashes out to help you grab an enemy after you distract the foe with your attack. The foe you hit becomes Grabbed, as if you had succeeded at an Athletics check to Grapple the foe.

## Vestige's Wings Feat 16

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with a fly Speed

* * *

You embraced a vestige from a flying monster allowing you to fly. This is almost always in the form of a set of wings on your back, but it could be something more esoteric from a creature that flies without wings. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.

## Vestige's Stampede Feat 18

**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication, you must defeat a monster with Trample

* * *

You added a vestige from a trampling monster to your leg or footwear, allowing you to trample your foes underfoot. This often incorporates parts from the monster's own legs and feet, and when you use Vestige's Stampede, your own legs might briefly grow larger and embody the creature's essence more fully. You Stride up to double your Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures at least one size smaller, trampling each creature whose space you enter. You can attempt to trample the same creature only once in a single use of Vestige's Stampede. You deal bludgeoning damage for your foot unarmed attack, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is better.

**Special** When you take this feat, you gain a foot unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is in the brawling weapon group. If you already have a better foot unarmed attack, you can use that instead.
