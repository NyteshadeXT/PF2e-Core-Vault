*   **2nd** The weapon can cast _Acid Splash_ as a cantrip, heightened to half the item's level rounded up
*   **4th** The weapon can cast _Acidic Burst_ once per day
*   **6th** The weapon's _acidic burst_ heightens to 2nd level and it can cast either _Acid Arrow_ or _acidic burst_ once per day, but not both
*   **8th** The weapon's _Acidic Burst_ heightens to 3rd level, and it can cast _acid arrow_ and _acidic burst_ each once per day
*   **10th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage
*   **12th** The weapon's _acid arrow_ heightens to 4th level, and the weapon can cast _Acid Storm_ once per day

**Path** Might

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage
*   **6th** The additional acid damage increases to 1d4
*   **8th** The additional acid damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target's armor (if any) takes 3d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead

*   **18th** The additional acid damage increases to 1d8

*   **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 persistent acid damage
*   **6th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional acid damage
*   **8th** The persistent acid damage increases to 1d6. On a critical hit, the target's armor (if any) takes3d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead
*   **12th** The acid damage dealt by this imbued property (including the persistent acid damage) ignores resistances
*   **14th** The persistent acid damage on a hit increases to 1d8
*   **16th** The persistent acid damage from the imbued property eats away at a foe's resistances. Every time a foe or the foe's armor or shield takes damage from the persistent acid damage at the end of their turn, any resistances and Hardness decrease by 1 for 1 minute. This effect is cumulative
*   **18th** The persistent acid damage on a hit increases to 1d10
