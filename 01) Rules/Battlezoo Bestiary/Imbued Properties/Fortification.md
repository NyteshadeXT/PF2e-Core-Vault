# Fortification
Abjuration

Magical

**Type** Armor (must be medium or heavy)

**Parts** The monster must have resistance or immunity to precision damage or critical hits.

* * *

**Effect** You imbue the armor with powerful fortifications to ward off deadly attacks. This imbued property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2. When the imbued property is at least 6th level, each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a Flat Check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. The flat check's DC decreases by 1 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a minimum of DC 13 at 20th level.
