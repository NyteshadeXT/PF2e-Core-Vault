# Spell
Magical

**Type** Skill Item

**Parts** The creature must either possess the skill matching the skill item or be capable of casting the chosen spell

* * *

**Effect** You imbue the item with a magic spell. You can either use one of the suggested spells for the given skill or work with the GM to determine another spell. The spell shouldn't be one that is particularly long-lasting like mage armor and you and the GM should think carefully before granting spells that only affect the caster like true strike. Choose a magical tradition that can cast the spell you chose; the item casts the spell using that tradition. At 4th level, you can imbue a 1st-level spell. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, you can imbue a spell of 1 spell level higher, and if you keep the same spell, the spells heightens to the new maximum level.

Suggested spells for each skill are as follows:

*   **Acrobatics** _Feather Fall_
*   **Arcana** _Magic Missile_
*   **Athletics** _Jump_
*   **Crafting** _Mending_
*   **Deception** _Illusory Disguise_
*   **Diplomacy** _Charm_
*   **Intimidation** _Fear_
*   **Lore** _Share Lore_ (Lore associated with the item only)
*   **Medicine** _Heal_
*   **Nature** _Summon Plant or Fungus_
*   **Occultism** _Object Reading_
*   **Performance** _Enthrall_
