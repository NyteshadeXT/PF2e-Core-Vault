# Sturdy
Abjuration

Magical

**Type** Shield

**Parts** The monster must have Hardness, resistance to physical damage, or resistance to one of the three physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). In some cases, you and the GM might decide together that a monster with resistance to physical damage because it is amorphous or gaseous doesn't provide appropriate parts.

**Effect** You imbue the shield to make it even hardier than other shields. As long as this imbued property’s level is equal to the item level of the shield it imbues, increase the shield’s Hardness by 3 and increase the shield’s Hit Points by 6 and BT by 3 for each additional Hardness you add this way; for each level the imbued property is below the shield’s item level, reduce the increased Hardness by 1, to a minimum of 0. If this increases the shield’s Hardness by 1 or more, additionally increase the shield’s Hit Points by twice the shield’s final Hardness, and increase the shield’s Broken Threshold by an amount equal to the shield’s final Hardness.
