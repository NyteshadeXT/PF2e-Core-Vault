# Effect: Unravel (Weapon)
## Level 1
### 






An unraveling object takes 2d8 persistent spirit damage

A creature wielding an unraveling weapon takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls. An unraveling object makes a flat check each round, just like a creature, to stop the persistent damage. An unraveler can cast mending on any unraveling object or creature to immediately end the persistent chaotic damage.
