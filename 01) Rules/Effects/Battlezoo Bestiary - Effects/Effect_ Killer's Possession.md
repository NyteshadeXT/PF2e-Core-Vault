# Effect: Killer's Possession
## Level 1
### 






The killing intent's bloodlust allows its corporeal vessel to exceed its normal bodily limits. A creature possessed by the killing intent deals 4 additional damage on its melee Strikes, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and gains the Quickened condition; it can use the extra action each round only for Strike and Stride actions.
