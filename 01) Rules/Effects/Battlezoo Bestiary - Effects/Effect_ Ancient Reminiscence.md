# Effect: Ancient Reminiscence
## Level 1
### 




Appealing to a lost savior’s heroic past can temporarily weaken its defenses as it realizes the horror of what it has become. A creature can spend an action to attempt a DC 28 Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check to remind a lost savior of its forgotten past.

**Critical Success** Until the creature’s next turn, the lost savior is flatfooted and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to AC and saving throws.
**Success** Until the creature’s next turn, the lost savior is flat-footed.
**Failure** The lost savior is unmoved.
