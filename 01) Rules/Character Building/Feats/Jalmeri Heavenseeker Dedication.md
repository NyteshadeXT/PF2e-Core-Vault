# Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Student of Perfection Dedication, or you've trained with a champion of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven
* * *
You become trained in either Acrobatics or Occultism; if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the [[01) Rules/Character Building/Feats/Ki Rush|Ki Rush]] or [[01) Rules/Character Building/Feats/Ki Strike|Ki Strike]] monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[Actions/Refocus|Refocus]] activity as a monk does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st‚Äêlevel monk feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the [[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.NaG4fy33coUdSFtH|Jalmeri Heavenseeker]] or [[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.EwlYs1OzaMj9BB5I|Student of Perfection]] archetypes.
