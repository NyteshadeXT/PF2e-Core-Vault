# Vestige Hunter Dedication (Vision)
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




You have learned how to retain vestiges from your foes and incorporate them into your own gear, attaching pieces imbued with meaning from your most important battles. The first vestiges you added have enhanced your senses. You gain low-light vision and darkvision.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vestige hunter archetype.
