# Basic Monster Mage Spellcasting
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monster Mage Dedication
* * *
You gain a 1st-level spell slot, which you can use to prepare monster mage spells from your tokens. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level spell slot. At 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level spell slot. When you prepare a spell from a token, you can heighten the spell (or reduce its level if the creature's innate spell was heightened above the minimum level); you need not cast it at the same spell level as the creature did. You can prepare a spell from the same token multiple times if you want to cast the spell several times during the day.
