# Vestige's Ferocity `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; you must defeat a monster with ferocity
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed.

* * *

You incorporated a vestige from a creature with the ferocious tenacity to cling to life. It wasn't enough to protect the creature when you defeated it, but perhaps that ferocious life force will save you now in your time of need. You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your wounded condition increases by 1.
