# Vestige's Grab `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vestige Hunter Dedication; defeat a monster with Grab or Improved Grab
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike, and either you have a hand free or your Strike used a grapple weapon.

* * *

You attached a vestige from a grabbing monster either to your weapons or near where you make your unarmed attacks, typically a piece of the monster that it used to grab foes. The vestige lashes out to help you grab an enemy after you distract the foe with your attack. The foe you hit becomes Grabbed, as if you had succeeded at an Athletics check to Grapple the foe.
