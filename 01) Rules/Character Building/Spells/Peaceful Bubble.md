# Peaceful Bubble   
## Spell 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Cast** 10 minutes**Range** touch
**Area** 100-foot burst
**Duration** 24 hours
* * * 
An opaque shell of drifting, iridescent runes covers the area, creating a bubble. You can choose to make the burst smaller, in 10-foot increments. The runes don't block travel, but those inside the bubble can't perceive those outside it and vice versa. Detection and scrying effects are likewise blocked.

Creatures sleeping within the bubble are immune to dreams sent by spells. Those sleeping 8 hours reduce their [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed]] condition by 2 instead of 1.
