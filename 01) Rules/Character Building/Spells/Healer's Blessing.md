# Healer's Blessing  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 willing living creature
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to vital energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.

The target regains additional Hit Points from _healer's blessing_ only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once, when they are first healed.

**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
