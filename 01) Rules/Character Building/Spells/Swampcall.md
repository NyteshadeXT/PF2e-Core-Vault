# Swampcall  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[earth]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Area** 10-foot burst
**Saving Throw**  reflex
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You call upon the spirits of the soil to twist and churn, transforming the terrain in the targeted area into a sodden mess. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when you Cast this Spell must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature sinks partially into the mud. The creature takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds (except for its swim Speed, if any) and becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]]. These effects last until the creature leaves the area or until the end of its next turn, whichever comes first.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty to Speeds (except Swim speed) is -15 feet.
