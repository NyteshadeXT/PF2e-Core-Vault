# Spirit Object  1 or 2  
## Cantrip 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[hex]][[manipulate]][[witch]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 unattended object up to 1 bulk
* * * 
Using a sliver of Baba Yaga's power, you briefly bring an object to life. The object gains a means of locomotion, such as sprouting chicken legs, and Strides up to 25 feet to a space you decide within range. If you spent 2 actions Casting the Spell, the object then attacks one creature of your choice adjacent to its new space. Make a melee spell attack roll against the creature. On a success, the creature takes 3d4 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (as appropriate for the object), and on a critical success, it takes double damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the maximum Bulk of the target by 1 and the damage by 1d4.
