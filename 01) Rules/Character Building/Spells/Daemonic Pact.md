# Daemonic Pact   
## Ritual 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Cast** 1 day**Primary Check** Religion (expert; you must be a daemon or an urdefhan)
* * * 
You call upon the powers of Abaddon to grant you the assistance of a daemon. You call upon a daemon whose level can be no more than double _daemonic pact's_ spell rank, two daemons whose levels are each at least 2 less than double the spell rank, or three daemons whose levels are each at least 3 less than double the spell rank.

* * *

**Critical Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, and they require nothing in return for their service.

**Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, who serve you willingly, but require a sacrifice in the form of spilled blood (either another creature's or your own).

**Failure** You don't conjure any daemons.

**Critical Failure** You don't conjure any daemons, and the self-sacrifice required to perform the ritual leaves you [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]] if the spell rank is 5 or higher).
