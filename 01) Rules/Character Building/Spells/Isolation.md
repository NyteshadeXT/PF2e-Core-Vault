# Isolation  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[illusion]][[manipulate]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 3 rounds
* * * 
You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.

**Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
