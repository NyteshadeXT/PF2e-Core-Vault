# Warp Mind  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 7
### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
* * * 
You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] rituals and abilities that can remove non-magical effects can still counteract the effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] condition.

**Failure** The target is Confused for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target is Confused permanently.
