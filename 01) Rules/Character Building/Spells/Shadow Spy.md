# Shadow Spy   
## Spell 3
### [[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Range** 120 feet
**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations

You mix blood, soil, and shadow together to form a half-real homunculus in the shape of a crow, sparrow, or other bird. You then command the bird to fly to a location within range and observe all around it. The bird has the statistics of a homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares your Perception modifier. Once the spell's duration elapses or upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simple-"at dusk" or "when the judge leaves"), the bird flies to your location. If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn all that it saw since its creation.
