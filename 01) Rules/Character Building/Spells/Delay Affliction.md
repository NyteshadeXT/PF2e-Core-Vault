# Delay Affliction  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[focus]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[oracle]][[vitality]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
* * * 
With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points.

You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it.

The target is then temporarily immune to _delay affliction_ for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.
