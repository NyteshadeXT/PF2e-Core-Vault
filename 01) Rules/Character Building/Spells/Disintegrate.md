# Disintegrate  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[attack]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature, unattended object, or force construct
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
* * * 
A black tracer bolt flies toward your target, and upon making contact intensifies into a powerful destructive beam. Make a spell attack against the target. If you hit an object or force construct (such as a wall of force), it's destroyed with no save unless it's an artifact or similarly powerful. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage type) with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save. A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine powder; its gear remains.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d10.
