# Eat Fire  `pf2:r`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[Fire]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Duration** until the end of your next turn
* * * 
**Trigger** You would take fire damage.

* * *

You consume and ingest fire, making it less harmful to you. You gain resistance 5 to fire damage until the end of the current turn. During the remaining duration of the spell, you can use the Belch Smoke action. The spell ends if you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], inhale, or exhale (this includes speaking).

[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Eat Fire|Spell Effect: Eat Fire]]

**Belch Smoke** `pf2:1` You exhale what remains of the smoke, ending the spell and creating a smoke cloud in a 5-foot burst within 20 feet. All creatures within the smoke cloud are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+3)** The resistance increases by 5.
