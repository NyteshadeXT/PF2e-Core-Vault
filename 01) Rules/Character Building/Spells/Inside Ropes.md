# Inside Ropes  `pf2:1`  
## Cantrip 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
You pull a large handful of guts from your midsection. Removing these guts doesn't harm you. You can use the guts as 50 feet of rope to help you [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], and they help attach you to a wall. You move half as quickly as usual while climbing with your guts (minimum 5 feet), but you can attempt a DC 5 Flat check check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. Other creatures can use your guts to climb like a squishy rope, but the guts don't help anyone but you attach to a wall. If you let go of your guts or your guts are damaged, the spell ends.

* * *

Heightened (3rd) You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using your guts.
