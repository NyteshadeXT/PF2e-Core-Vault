# Stumbling Curse  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[curse]][[focus]][[hex]][[manipulate]][[witch]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes a -2 status penalty to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.

**Failure** As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.
