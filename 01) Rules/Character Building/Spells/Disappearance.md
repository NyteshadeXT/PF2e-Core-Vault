# Disappearance  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 8
### [[illusion]][[manipulate]][[subtle]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.
