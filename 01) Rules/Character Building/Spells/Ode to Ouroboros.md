# Ode to Ouroboros  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[bard]][[composition]][[concentrate]][[focus]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** the triggering creature
* * * 
**Trigger** A creature's dying condition would reach the value at which they would die.

* * *

Your ode staves off death. The target's dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] and death effects.
