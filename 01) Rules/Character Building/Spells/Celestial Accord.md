# Celestial Accord  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[emotion]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 2 creatures that each have an unfriendly or worse attitude toward the other
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You intervene in a heated disagreement between two creatures, encouraging them to put aside their differences and find some common ground. The emotional heat of the prior moment becomes only a memory. Each target must make a Will save. A creature currently engaged in combat can't get a result worse than success, and a target that is subject to hostility from any other creature ceases to be affected by celestial accord.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is filled with doubt about its own intentions and feels an urge to cooperate with the other. It has a -2 status penalty to attack rolls against the other target for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature can't make hostile actions against the other target and its attitude toward the other target improves to indifferent for the spell's duration.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature's attitude toward the other target improves to friendly for the duration and is indifferent thereafter (until something happens to change that attitude normally).
