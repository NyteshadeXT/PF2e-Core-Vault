# Veil of Confidence  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[Mental]]

**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition by 1, and whenever you would become Frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, _veil of confidence_ reduces your frightened value form that effect, and then ends.
