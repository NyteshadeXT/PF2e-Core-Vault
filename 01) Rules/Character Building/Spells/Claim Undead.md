# Claim Undead  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[focus]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[oracle]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 undead creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if yo give it a new order that is against its nature.
