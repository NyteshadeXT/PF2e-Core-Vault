# Powerful Inhalation  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[air]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Area** 10-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
* * * 
You rapidly draw the air from your surroundings, hoarding it for yourself. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 5d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save can't speak above a raspy whisper for 1 round. A creature that critically fails can't speak or use abilities that require it to breathe for 1 round. This prevents it from using effects that require speech, such as casting spells with verbal components, and from using a breath weapon or similar ability.

Creatures made of air (such as air elementals) attempting a save against this spell get a degree of success one worse than they rolled.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6.
