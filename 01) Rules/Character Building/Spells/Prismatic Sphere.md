# Prismatic Sphere  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 9
### [[concentrate]][[light]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 10 feet
**Duration** 1 hour
* * * 
You create a seven-layered sphere to protect an area. This multicolored sphere functions like a [[Spells/Prismatic Wall|Prismatic Wall]] but is shaped in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner of your space. You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
