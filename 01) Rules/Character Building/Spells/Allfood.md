# Allfood   
## Spell 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[primal]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Targets** 1 unattended non-magical object of 1 Bulk or less
* * * 
You transform one object into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This allfood always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency, regardless of its original nature. One bulk of allfood provides enough sustenance to feed one Medium creature for a day.

After 1 day, if no one has eaten the allfood, it reverts to its original form. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature and most Tiny creatures eat one-sixteenth as much, while most Large creatures eat 10 times as much, Huge creatures need 100 times as much, and so on.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Double the maximum bulk (to a maximum of 256 bulk at 10th level).
