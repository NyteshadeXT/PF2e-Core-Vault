# Temporal Distortion  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[oracle]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
* * * 
You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll 1d4. On a 1, the foe becomes clumsy; on a 2, it becomes enfeebled; on a 3, it becomes stupefied; and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is either [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds.
