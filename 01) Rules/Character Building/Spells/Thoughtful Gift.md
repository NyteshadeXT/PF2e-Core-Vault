# Thoughtful Gift  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`  
## Spell 1
### [[manipulate]][[teleportation]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 willing creature
* * * 
You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target's hand, if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don't. The target knows what object you are attempting to send them. If the target is [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or refuses to accept your gift, or if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails.

* * *

**Heightened (3rd)** The spell's range increases to 500 feet.

**Heightened (5th)** As 3rd level, and the object's maximum Bulk increases to 1. You can [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast the Spell]] with 3 actions instead of 1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile and you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar with the target.
