### [[auditory]][[cleric]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]

**Range** 30-foot cone
**Targets** 1 or more creatures
**Saving Throw** basic will

You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies' hearts and deals 1d8 mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by emotion effects, _lament_ deals additional mental damage equal to the counteract rank of the highest-level effect.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.
