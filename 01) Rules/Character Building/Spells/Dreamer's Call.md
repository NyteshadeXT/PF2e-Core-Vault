# Dreamer's Call  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[illusion]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** until the end of the target&#x27;s next turn
* * * 
You create a vivid, illusory daydream drawn from the images of the target's dreams. The daydream appears in an unoccupied space in range, and you attempt to draw the target toward it.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the daydream.

**Failure** The target is fascinated with the daydream and pursues a course of action you choose as its first action after you Cast the Spell: approach the daydream, run away from it (as the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition), Release what it's holding as an offering, or Drop Prone in obeisance.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and does nothing else.
