# Hologram Cage  `pf2:3`  
## Cantrip 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[illusion]][[light]][[manipulate]][[psychic]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Area** 20-foot cube
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
**Area** 1 cube 20 feet on each side

* * *

You weave light into a cube of vivid and fantastic patterns. The walls shed bright light for 10 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and completely block line of sight; creatures within the cage can't be seen by creatures outside of it, though they can see each other, and creatures outside of it can't see into it. You can [[Actions/Dismiss|Dismiss]] the spell, and if you Cast the Spell again, your previous hologram cage ends.

**Heightened (7th)** The range of the spell increases to 80 feet, and you can expand the cube to be 25 feet on each side.
