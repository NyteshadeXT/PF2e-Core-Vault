You unravel the magic of a spell that affects a container, door, or lock, converting it into energy you can repurpose to power your own spells.

Attempt a counteract check against the target spell or magical effect that wards or seals a doorway or chest, such as [[Spells/Lock|Lock]], or against a spell or effect that deals damage or delivers secondary effects when it's opened, such as [[Spells/Rune Trap|Rune Trap]]. If you succeed, you recover its energy, restoring one of your expended spell slots of 3rd rank or lower.
