**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 willing creature

You protect your target from going astray in hostile territory by tracking where it's already been, helping it deduce where it still needs to go. The target leaves a glittering trail behind it that lasts for the spell's duration. This trail doesn't denote the direction or the order of its path-it merely indicates where the target has moved during the spell's duration.

**Heightened (2nd)** The duration increases to 8 hours.

**Heightened (3rd)** The duration increases to last until your next daily preparations.
