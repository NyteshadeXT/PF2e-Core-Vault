# Interplanar Teleport   
## Spell 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]][[teleportation]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Cast** 10 minutes**Range** 5 feet
**Targets** up to 8 willing creatures
* * * 
**Requirements** You have a planar key for the destination plane, used as a locus

* * *

You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of existence. The targets move to another plane, such as the Plane of Fire, the Netherworld, or the Outer Rifts. You must know the destination plane exists and use a magic planar key created from material from that plane as a locus for the spell. While the planar keys for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell _interplanar teleport_, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare or possibly even unique planar keys.

The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20Ã—25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. _Interplanar teleport_ doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting _interplanar teleport_ again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.
