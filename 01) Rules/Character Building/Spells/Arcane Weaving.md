# Arcane Weaving   
## Ritual 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

**Cost** rare silks worth a total value of 20 gp x the spell rank
**Primary Check** Arcana or Occultism (expert)
**Secondary Checks** Arcana, Crafting, or Occultism
* * * 
You and the secondary casters weave together spells (and, if anadis, silk) in a complex ritual that combines magical learning with art, allowing all the participants to share spells they know with one another.

**Success** You or any secondary caster can swap any spell in your spell repertoire for a spell in the spell repertoire of any other participant. This spell can't be a higher level than the ritual's level.

**Failure** None of the participants can swap spells.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and all participants are [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours and can't reduce their stupefied condition below 1 for 24 hours.
