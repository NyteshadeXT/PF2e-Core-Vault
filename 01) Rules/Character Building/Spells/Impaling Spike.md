# Impaling Spike  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 5
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[metal]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  reflex
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made of cold iron and deals 8d6 piercing damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.

**Success** The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.

**Failure** The target is impaled through a leg or another nonvital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. It can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] as long as it's impaled.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
