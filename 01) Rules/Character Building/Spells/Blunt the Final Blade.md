# Blunt the Final Blade   
## Ritual 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[death]]

**Cast** 1 day; **Secondary Casters** 3
**Cost** powdered dawnsilver and rare grave dirt worth 10,000 gp
**Primary Check** Occultism or Religion (legendary)
**Secondary Checks** Arcana, Crafting, Society, and the other skill not used for the primary check
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 final blade
* * * 
You anoint the _[[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]]_ with powdered dawnsilver and grave dirt while speaking softly and carefully to the souls trapped within it. You create a mystical pathway for the souls to escape through and urge them to draw out the magic of the final blade with them as they depart.

**Critical Success** As success, and the souls also grant a boon; the primary and secondary casters gain a +2 status bonus to saves against death and fear effects for the next year.

[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Blunt the Final Blade (Critical Success)|Spell Effect: Blunt the Final Blade (Critical Success)]]

**Success** The souls escape the _final blade_ and peacefully pass on to their eternal rewards, as appropriate for each soul. The final blade is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.

**Failure** The ritual has no effect.

**Critical Failure** The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the _final blade_ are released in a furious rush as a gray death that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The _final blade_ retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.
