**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
Calling out the fifth line of the Crimson Oath, you seal your most grievous injuries with a stroke of your blade. The first time each round that you Strike with your weapon and deal damage to a foe, you recover a number of HP equal to twice shall not falter, shall not rout's level. This healing can't raise your current HP above half of your maximum HP.
