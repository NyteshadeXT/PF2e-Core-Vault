# Prismatic Shield  `pf2:1`  
## Spell 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[light]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Duration** until the start of your next turn
* * * 
Shield-sized shards of multicolored light manifest in the air around you, each rotating quickly to intercept attacks.

Melee attacks against you impact a randomly colored shard, subjecting the attacker to a random effect from [[Spells/Prismatic Spray|Prismatic Spray]], with a saving throw of the type indicated in that spell.

The shards automatically block physical ranged attacks the size of a spear or smaller, such as arrows, bolts, and javelins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks with larger ranged weapons.

Any spell that targets you requires the caster to succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC, or it fails to affect you.
