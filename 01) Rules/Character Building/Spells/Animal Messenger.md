### [[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[primal]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Range** 120 feet
**Duration** see text
* * * 
You offer food, and an ordinary Tiny animal within range approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you within the animal. You can also attach a small object or note up to light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if it makes it there, it waits nearby and allows nonhostile creatures to approach and remove the attached object. The spell ends after the message is delivered or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.

If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.
