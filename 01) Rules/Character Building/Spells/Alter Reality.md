# Alter Reality  `pf2:3`  
## Spell 10
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]
* * * 
You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

*   Duplicate any occult spell of 9th rank or lower to which you have access.
*   Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th rank or lower. It must be common or you must have access.
*   Produce any effect whose power is in line with the above.
*   Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
