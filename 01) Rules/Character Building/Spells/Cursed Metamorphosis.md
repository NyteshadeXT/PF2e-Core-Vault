# Cursed Metamorphosis  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[concentrate]][[curse]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[polymorph]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]]. When it recovers from the Sickened condition, its features revert to normal.

**Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.

**Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
