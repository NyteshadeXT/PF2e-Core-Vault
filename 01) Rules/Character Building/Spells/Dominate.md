# Dominate  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations
* * * 
You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.

**Failure** You control the target. It gains the [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

* * *

**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
