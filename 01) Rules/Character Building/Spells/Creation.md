## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[exploration]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Cast** 1 minute**Range** 0 feet
**Duration** 1 hour
* * * 
You conjure a temporary object from magical energy. It must consist of earthen or plant-derived matter (such as wood, paper, brick, or stone) and be 5 cubic feet or smaller. It can't rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills a cost or the like, and can't be made of precious materials or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item. The spell gains the appropriate trait for the item created, typically earth, plant, or wood.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** The item is metal and can include common minerals, like feldspar or quartz. The spell gains the metal trait if used to create a metal object
