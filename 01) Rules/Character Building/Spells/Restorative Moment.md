Your patron weaves the threads of time around the target, giving them some of the benefits of a day's passage. The target decreases the values of any [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed]] and [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained]] conditions it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw against each affliction it has with a stage length of 1 day or less. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
