# Vampiric Maiden  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[void]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage.

**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is Immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]](the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and void damage increase by 1d4 each.
