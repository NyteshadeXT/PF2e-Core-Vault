# Spiritual Anamnesis  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target's mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 3]].
