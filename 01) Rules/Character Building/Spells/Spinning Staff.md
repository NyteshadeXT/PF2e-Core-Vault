# Spinning Staff  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[magus]]

* * * 
You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next [[Actions/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]]. Make a melee Strike with your staff against one foe and then a second melee Strike with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
