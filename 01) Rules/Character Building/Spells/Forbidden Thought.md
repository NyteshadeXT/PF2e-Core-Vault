# Forbidden Thought  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[Mental]][[psychic]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** basic will
* * * 
You place a psychic lock in a foe's mind that prevents it from a specific action. Choose "Strike," "Stride," "Cast a Spell," or a specific action you know the creature to have (such as "Breath Weapon" against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 2d6 mental damage (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
