# Arcane Countermeasure  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[focus]][[manipulate]][[sorcerer]]

**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** the spell cast by the triggering creature
* * * 
**Trigger** A creature within range that you can see Casts a Spell.

* * *

You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's rank by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's rank below its minimum.

For example, a 5th-rank cone of cold would remain 5th-rank, but a 5th-rank fireball would become 4th-rank. Targets still gain all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's rank.
