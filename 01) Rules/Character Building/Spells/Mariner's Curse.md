# Mariner's Curse  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 5
### [[concentrate]][[curse]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
* * * 
You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]]. Reducing its sickened condition to 0 ends the curse.

**Failure** The target becomes sickened 1 and can't reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by 4th-rank [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]].

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].
