# Perfected Body  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

* * * 
**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a saving throw against an effect that has the morph, poison, or polymorph trait, or that would make you [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]], or [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened]].

* * *

Your body's perfection keeps you just a little bit healthier than most. You get a failure if you rolled a critical failure or a success if you rolled a failure.
