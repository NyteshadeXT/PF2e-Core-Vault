## Focus 4
### [[cleric]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Duration** 1 minute

**Trigger** You take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

You shift yourself to adapt to the mystical wavelengths of the energy damage, protecting yourself from further harm. You gain resistance 5 to the triggering energy type; you gain this resistance after you take the triggering damage, so it applies only to future damage you take during the duration.
