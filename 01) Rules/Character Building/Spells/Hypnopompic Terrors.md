# Hypnopompic Terrors  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 8
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[emotion]][[fear]][[illusion]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** up to 10 creatures

* * * 
You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing 6d12 mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]] and takes half the mental damage.

**Failure** The target is frightened 2, is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round, and takes the full mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 2, is paralyzed for 2 rounds, and takes double the mental damage.
