# Shattering Gem  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[concentrate]][[earth]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a DC 11 Flat check. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing the creature that destroyed it 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save), as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The gem has 5 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8.
