# Command  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[linguistic]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** until the end of the target&#x27;s next turn
* * * 
You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition), release what it's holding, drop [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], or stand in place. It can't [[Actions/Delay|Delay]] or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** For the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command.

**Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
