# Oaken Resilience  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[plant]][[wood]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 willing creature
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
The target's skin becomes tough, with a consistency like bark or wood. The target gains resistance 2 to bludgeoning and piercing damage and weakness 3 to fire. After the target takes fire damage, it can Dismiss the spell as a free action triggered by taking the damage; doing so doesn't reduce the fire damage the target was dealt.

**Heightened (+2)** The resistances increase by 2, and the weakness increases by 3.
