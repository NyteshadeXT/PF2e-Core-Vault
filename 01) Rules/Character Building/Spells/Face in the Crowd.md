# Face in the Crowd  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[visual]]

**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the crowd, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by the crowd. This counts as setting up a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception and you add your level even if you're untrained.
