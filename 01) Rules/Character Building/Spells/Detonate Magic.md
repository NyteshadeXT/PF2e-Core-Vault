# Detonate Magic  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Area** 5-foot emanation
**Targets** 1 magic item or spell effect
**Saving Throw** basic reflex
* * * 
You cause the magic within the target to dissipate in a destructive explosion. You attempt to counteract the target. If the attempt succeeds, an explosion of magical force deals 8d6 force damage with a basic Reflex save. If you successfully counteract the magic of an item, it's deactivated for 1 week (or destroyed on a critical success) and the explosion is a 5-foot emanation from the item. If you successfully counteract a spell, the effect ends and the explosion affects either all creatures in the spells' area or the target of the spell and all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around it.
