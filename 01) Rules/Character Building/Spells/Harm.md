# Harm  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`  
## Spell 1
### [[manipulate]][[void]]
**Traditions** [[divine]]
**Range** varies
**Targets** 1 living creature or 1 willing undead creature
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
* * * 
You channel void energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 void damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

`pf2:1` The spell has a range of touch.

`pf2:2` **(concentrate)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

`pf2:3` **(concentrate)** You disperse void energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
