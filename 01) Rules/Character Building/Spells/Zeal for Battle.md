# Zeal for Battle  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[focus]][[fortune]][[Mental]]

**Range** 10 feet
**Targets** you and the triggering ally
* * * 
**Trigger** You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.

* * *

You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls. You each still use your own Perception modifier or other statistic to determine your results.
