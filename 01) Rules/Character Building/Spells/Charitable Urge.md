# Charitable Urge  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[divine]], [[occult]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
You speak on the virtue of charity, compelling the target to give away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target has no items on its person, the spell fails.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]] as it wrestles with the urge.

**Failure** On its next turn, before it does anything else, the target must present the nearest creature with an item in its possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the only item it has is one that it's currently using to defend itself, such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose to be Stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This might require the target to [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and handing the item to the target always requires an Interact action.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of failure on each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, ending it entirely on a critical success.
