# Imprint Message  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[occult]]
**Range** touch
**Targets** 1 object
* * * 
You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts [[Spells/Object Reading|Object Reading]] on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a [[Spells/Retrocognition|Retrocognition]] spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with [[Spells/Read Aura|Read Aura]] of a higher spell rank than _imprint message_, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast this Spell]], any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of _imprint message_ fade.
