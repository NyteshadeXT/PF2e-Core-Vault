# Dimensional Assault  `pf2:1`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[magus]][[teleportation]]

**Range** half your Speed
* * * 
You tumble through space, making a short dimensional hop to better position yourself for an attack. Teleport to any square in range that's within reach of a creature, and then make a melee Strike against one creature within your reach.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
