## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[01) Rules/Bestiaries/Bestiary 1/Shadow]][[sorcerer]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You steal a creature's shadow, leaving it weakened and vulnerable. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target takes 3d4 void damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for the spell's duration as you tear its shadow away, collecting it in your hand. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], you can throttle the shadow to deal 3d4 void damage to the target (basic Fortitude save). Until the spell ends, the target doesn't cast a shadow.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage when the spell is cast and when it is sustained increases by 1d4 void.
