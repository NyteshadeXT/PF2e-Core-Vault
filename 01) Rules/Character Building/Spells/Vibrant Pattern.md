# Vibrant Pattern  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 6
### [[illusion]][[incapacitation]][[manipulate]][[subtle]][[visual]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Area** 10-foot burst
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is Blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the Blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature is Blinded for 1 minute.
