# Sea of Thought  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 3
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Range** 60 feet
**Area** 15-foot burst
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The radius of the spell's area increases by 5 feet.
