# Bit of Luck  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[fortune]][[manipulate]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 willing creature
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast _bit of luck_ again, any previous _bit of luck_ you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with _bit of luck_, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
