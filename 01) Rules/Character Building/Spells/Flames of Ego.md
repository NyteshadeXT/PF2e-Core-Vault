# Flames of Ego  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 5
### [[concentrate]][[Fire]][[incapacitation]][[light]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** varies
* * * 
Elegant flames of incredible beauty coruscate across the target's body, creating overconfidence and carelessness. The target attempts a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target sheds bright light in a 20-foot emanation (and dim light to the next 40 feet) and becomes [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with itself for 1 round. It must spend at least 1 action on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence. Using actions that include such a display—such as using [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] to show off—count toward this requirement.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute and the target can't act hostile toward a creature until that creature acts hostile toward the target.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target must spend at least 2 actions on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence.
