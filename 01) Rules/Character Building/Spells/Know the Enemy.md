# Know the Enemy  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]][[focus]][[fortune]][[manipulate]]

* * * 
**Trigger** You roll initiative and can see a creature, you succeed at an attack roll against a creature, or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells.

You quickly remind yourself of useful information. Use a Recall Knowledge action, rolling the appropriate skill check to identify the triggering creature's abilities. You can roll your check twice and use the better result.
