# Fungal Infestation  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[primal]]
**Range** touch
**Area** 15-foot cone
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.

**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Fungal Infestation|Spell Effect: Fungal Infestation]]

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
