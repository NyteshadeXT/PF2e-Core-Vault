# Mercurial Stride  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[metal]][[GM Tools/Bestiary Ability Glossary/Poison]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
* * * 
Your form ripples as you take on the fluidity and toxicity of quicksilver. You partially shift into a liquid metal form and Stride up to twice your speed. During this movement, you can pass through one creature's space—without needing to attempt a check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]]—by splitting into droplets of mercury and reforming on the other side, though you can't end your turn in such a space. Passing through a creature's space in this way exposes it to mercury poisoning, with a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]].

**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] and takes 6d6 poison damage.

**Critical Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] and takes 12d6 poison damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 on a failure and 2d6 on a critical failure.
