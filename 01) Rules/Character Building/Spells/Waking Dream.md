# Waking Dream  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 4
### [[concentrate]][[focus]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You cloud the target's mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is distracted by the visions and treats all other creatures as [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 round, and you can't Sustain the Spell to increase the duration.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]]. In addition to the creatures present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air, attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion. Even if the confused effect ends early, the target treats all other creatures as concealed for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target gets no save to end the effect early.
