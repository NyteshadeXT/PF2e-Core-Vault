# Reinforce Eidolon  `pf2:1`  
## Cantrip 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[summoner]]

**Range** 100 feet
**Targets** your eidolon
**Duration** 1 round
* * * 
You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and reinforce your eidolon's defenses. Your eidolon gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws, plus resistance to all damage equal to half the spell's rank. Your eidolon can benefit from either [[Spells/Boost Eidolon|Boost Eidolon]] or Reinforce Eidolon, but not both; if you cast one of these spells during the other's duration, the newer spell replaces the older one.
