# Gust of Wind  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 1
### [[air]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Area** 60-foot line
**Saving Throw**  fortitude
**Duration** until the start of your next turn
* * * 
A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you are when you Cast the Spell to the line's opposite end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature can't move against the wind.

**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If it was flying, it takes the effects of critical failure instead.

**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind's direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
