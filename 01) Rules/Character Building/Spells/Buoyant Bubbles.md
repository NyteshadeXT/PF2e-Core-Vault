# Buoyant Bubbles  `pf2:1`  
## Spell 1
### [[concentrate]][[water]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You create a thin layer of foamy bubbles that adhere to the target, causing it to float in water and similar liquids. The target doesn't sink, even if it hasn't succeeded at a Swim check this round; an already-sinking target resurfaces with the bubbles' help over the course of 1 round. If on a plane where the water or liquid has a surface, the bubbles also prevent the target from diving beneath that surface unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** You can target up to 5 creatures.
