# Stone Lance  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[concentrate]][[earth]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Range** 120 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
You conjure a jagged lance of stone and then launch it at a foe. Make a spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, you deal 6d6 piercing damage and the lance impales the creature, giving it a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds unless it Escapes. On a critical hit, if the creature is on the ground, the lance also embeds into the ground and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizes]] the creature until it Escapes. A creature that Escapes after being impaled takes 3 bleed damage. When the spell ends, the lance crumbles into dirt, freeing the target if it hasn't Escaped.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6 and the persistent bleed damage for Escapes by 1.
