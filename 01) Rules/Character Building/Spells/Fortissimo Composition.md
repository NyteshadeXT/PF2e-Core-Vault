### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[bard]][[concentrate]][[focus]][[spellshape]]

* * * 
You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide with your _courageous anthem_, _rallying anthem_, or _song of strength_ composition. If your next action is to cast one of these compositions, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually the highest Will DC of the composition's targets, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your composition depends on the result of your check.

* * *

**Critical Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +3.

**Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +2.

**Failure** Your composition provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
