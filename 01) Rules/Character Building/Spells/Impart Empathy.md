# Impart Empathy  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[emotion]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[occult]], [[primal]]
**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 animal
**Saving Throw**  will
**Duration** 1 day
* * * 
You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't unfriendly or hostile can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on it and to make very simple Requests of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can also target plants and fungi.
