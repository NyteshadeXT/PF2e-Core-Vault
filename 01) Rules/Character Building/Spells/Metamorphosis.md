## Spell 9
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[polymorph]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[primal]]
**Duration** 1 minute
* * * 
Harnessing your mastery of transformative magic, you hide forms within forms. You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a polymorph spell in your spell repertoire or that you could prepare of 8th-rank or lower (including any 8th-rank or lower heightened versions of spells you know). You gain 40 temporary Hit Points rather than the amount normally granted by the form.
