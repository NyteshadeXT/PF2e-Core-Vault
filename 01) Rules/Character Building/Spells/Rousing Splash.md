# Rousing Splash  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 1
### [[cantrip]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[water]]
**Traditions** [[divine]], [[primal]]
**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
* * * 
You cause a splash of cold water to descend on an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from _rousing splash_ for 10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of temporary Hit Points granted increases by 1d4.
