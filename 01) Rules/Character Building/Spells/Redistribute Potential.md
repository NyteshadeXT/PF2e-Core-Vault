# Redistribute Potential  `pf2:2`  
## Cantrip 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cantrip]][[Cold]][[concentrate]][[Fire]][[manipulate]][[psychic]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Area** 5-foot square
**Saving Throw** basic fortitude
* * * 
**Area** two adjacent 5-foot squares

* * *

Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take 4d4 damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
