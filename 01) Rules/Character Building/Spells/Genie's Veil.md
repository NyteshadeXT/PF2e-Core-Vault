# Genie's Veil  `pf2:r`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[focus]][[manipulate]][[sorcerer]]

**Range** 30 feet
**Targets** 1 willing creature
* * * 
**Trigger** A creature within range is attacked.

* * *

With a flourish, you fulfill a creature's wish for protection, bending reality to keep them from harm. The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature's turn.
