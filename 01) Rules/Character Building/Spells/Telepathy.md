# Telepathy  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 4
### [[concentrate]][[linguistic]][[manipulate]][[Mental]]
**Traditions** [[arcane]], [[occult]]
**Duration** 10 minutes
* * * 
You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language _telepathy_ loses the linguistic trait.
