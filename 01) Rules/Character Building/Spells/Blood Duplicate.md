# Blood Duplicate  `pf2:2`  
## Spell 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[manipulate]]

**Targets** 1 non-magical object of 1 Bulk or less
**Duration** 1 hour
* * * 
This spell deals you 1 piercing damage as you shape a magical duplicate of the target from your blood; you can't cast this spell if you don't have blood. This spell can't duplicate an item made of precious materials, or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. If you're ever more than 5 feet from the duplicate, the spell's duration immediately ends. The Perception DC to recognize the duplicate as false using any sense except touch is equal to 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Crafting proficiency bonus. The item feels wet and obviously fake to the touch. When the spell ends, the item collapses into a puddle of blood that quickly evaporates.
