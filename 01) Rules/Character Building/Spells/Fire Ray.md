# Fire Ray  `pf2:2`  
## Focus 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[cleric]][[concentrate]][[Fire]][[focus]][[manipulate]]

**Range** 60 feet
**Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** until the end of the target&#x27;s turn
* * * 
A blazing band of fire arcs through the air, lighting your opponent and the ground they stand upon on fire. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC. The ray deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). On any result other than a critical failure, the ground in the target's space catches fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn in one of the squares.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The ray's initial damage increases by 2d6, and the fire damage dealt by the burning space increases by 1d6.
