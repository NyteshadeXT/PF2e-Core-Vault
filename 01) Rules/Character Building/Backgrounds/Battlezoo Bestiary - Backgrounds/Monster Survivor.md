# Monster Survivor

### 






A rampaging monster attack destroyed your home, leaving you one of the few survivors from a once-thriving settlement. Whether you lost friends, loved ones, or just your home, you'll never forget what happened that day, and you'll never forgive. You've spent your days studying the specific type of monster that caused this calamity, and in the process learned of similar monster attacks. Now, you've become an adventurer to protect others from sharing your fate, and perhaps to someday find the monsters that set you down this path.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

Youâ€™re trained in the skill used to Recall Knowledge about the monsters that destroyed your home (for instance, Arcana for dragons or Religion for undead), and the Lore skill associated with that type of monster (for instance Dragon Lore). You gain the Assurance feat with either of those two skills.
