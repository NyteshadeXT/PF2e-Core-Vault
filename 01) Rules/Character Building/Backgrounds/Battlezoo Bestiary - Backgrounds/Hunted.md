# Hunted

### 






Whether it was monsters or monstrous people, you and others were captured and gathered together and released with the explicit purpose of allowing your captors to hunt down and outwit intelligent prey. Your captors promised that whichever of you was the last to survive would be let free, and given the option to join them. For days you hid, eluded, and outlasted your hunters and your fellow victims. Maybe you turned on your fellows to survive, or maybe you did your best to try to help everyone escape. Regardless, at the end of the hunt, you survived. You might have become an adventurer for reasons related to the exact events of that struggle, but ultimately, you adventure and hone your skills because the experience has ingrained in you the instinct that you must grow stronger and become the hunter, lest you forever remain the hunted.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill, and the Lore skill associated with the type of creature that hunted you or the terrain where you were hunted (for instance, Dragon Lore or Forest Lore). You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat.
