# Poacher

### 






It's illegal to hunt on lands owned by the nobility or royalty, with penalties ranging from dismemberment to deathâ€¦ if you're caught. But when the other choice is certain starvation for you and your family, that's no choice at all. Not only did you get away with it, you proved to be particularly skilled and got a taste for the thrill and danger of the hunt, even though your prey themselves weren't the cause of the danger, at first. For whatever reason, whether you were captured and escaped, nearly caught and forced to flee, or just wanted to move on to bigger things, you've left that life for a life of adventure, where you can hunt bigger and more dangerous prey.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill, and the Animal Lore skill. You gain the Monster Scavenger skill feat.
