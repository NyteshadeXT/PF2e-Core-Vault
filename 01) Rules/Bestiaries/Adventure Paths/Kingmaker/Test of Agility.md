    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature or object of at least 3 bulk moves onto the floor; the trap can use this reaction multiple times in a round, but only once per triggering creature or object\n**Effect** The floor pitches and rolls. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 33 Reflex check save.\n**Critical Success** The character can move across the room normally this turn, without having to attempt Acrobatics checks, but treats the unstable floor as difficult terrain.\n**Success** The character treats the ground in this room as difficult terrain, but each time they move they must succeed at a DC 30 Acrobatics check check or they fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] at the start of their turn. A character who falls prone must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex check save or fall into one of the two spiked pits to the north or south of the room (see Failure).\n**Failure** As success but the character automatically falls prone and must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex check save to avoid being pitched into one of the two spiked pits to the north or south of the room. A character who is pitched into a pit can attempt to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. The DC to Grab an Edge or [[Actions/Climb|Climb]] a pit's walls is 33. A character who falls into one of the pits plunges 50 feet onto a bed of spikes, taking 25 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 piercing damage (DC 33 Reflex check).\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the character automatically rolls into one of the two pits."
