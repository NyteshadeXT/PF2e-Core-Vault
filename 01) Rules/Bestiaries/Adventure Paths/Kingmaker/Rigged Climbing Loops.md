    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature climbs across the chasm without knowing which of the loops are rigged\n**Effect** The loops rip free, dropping the climber 20 feet into the chasm below and dealing 10 bludgeoning damage. The falling creature can use the [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling if it succeeds at a DC 11 Flat check; failure indicates that the edge [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] rips away as well."
