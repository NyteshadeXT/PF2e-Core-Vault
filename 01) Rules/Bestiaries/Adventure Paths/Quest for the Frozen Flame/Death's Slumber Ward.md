All living and undead creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will check save or become [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] ([[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(4 actions) Each thread of energy passes through a random living or undead creature within 60 feet, dealing 4d6 damage (DC 22 Will check) to the creature. A thread deals 4d6 void damage to living creatures and 4d6 vitality damage to undead creatures. Each thread passes through a different random creature, if possible. Each dissipated thread reduces the trap's number of actions by 1."
