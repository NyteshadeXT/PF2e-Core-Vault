    desc: "`pf2:r` (arcane, teleportation) **Trigger** A creature other than Dwandek opens the door\n**Effect** The triggering creature is drawn into a pocket plane of pure nightmare (DC 38 Will check save to resist). Each round at the start of their turn, the creature takes 4d8 mental damage as they are assaulted by otherworldly visions, and must succeed at a new Will save against the original DC to be ejected from the pocket plane and deposited in the center of area **A5**."
