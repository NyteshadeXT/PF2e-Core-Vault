    desc: "A raging spectral inferno arises out of thin air, strengthening all undead creatures within its area.

    desc: "`pf2:r` (mental) **Trigger** A living creature approaches within 10 feet of the remains of a victim of the original fire\n**Effect** Memories of the pain suffered by the fire's past victims assault the triggering creature's mind. The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will check save, and the haunt then rolls initiative.\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]].\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 3]], and it is offguard for as long as it remains within the haunt's area and for 3 rounds thereafter"

    desc: "(1 action) Phantom flames rage across the haunted area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each living creature within the area (DC 23 Will check save). Undead creatures in the area are infused with flames for the following round. They gain the fire trait and immunity to fire, and all their attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. Objects in the area are unaffected."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The flames cease 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area, but after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer up and the haunt is ready to trigger again."
