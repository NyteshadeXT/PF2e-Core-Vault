If someone uses a proxy or dupe for the theft or intrusion, the You can make a summoning rune of nearly any level. It summons a creature of a level equal to the trap's level. Use DCs by Level to determine the Thievery DC and spell DC, using the trap's level and applying a hard adjustment (+2). The Stealth modifier for the trap is equal to this number - 10. Stronger summoning runes usually require expert proficiency or better in Perception to find, and they might require a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable.trap unerringly targets the true perpetrator or perpetrators at any distance-even across planes.\n**Effect** The triggering creature and up to five coconspirators instantly revert to infants, losing all memories, class abilities, and other skills acquired during their lives (DC 44 Fortitude check negates). Reversing this effect is nearly impossible, requiring powerful magic such as _wish_."
