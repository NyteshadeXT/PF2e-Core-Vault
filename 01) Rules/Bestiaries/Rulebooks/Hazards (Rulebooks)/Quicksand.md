  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it's submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn't become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours."
