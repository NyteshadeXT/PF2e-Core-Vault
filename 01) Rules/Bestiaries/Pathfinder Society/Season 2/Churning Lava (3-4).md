    desc: "passive The target must attempt a DC 20 Reflex check save as the lava rapidly cools and solidifies. On a critical hit, use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of the save.\n**Success** The lava slides off the target with no additional effect.\n**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]]. The target or an adjacent creature can take an Interact action to remove the stone, removing the condition.\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]]. Each Interact action to remove the stone reduces the value of the clumsy condition by 1."
