### Description
Although magic is the predominant force behind many of the world's most powerful militaries, some nations still favor science, technology, or sheer firepower when it comes to warfare. Black powder and firearms may have been some of the most significant technological innovations of the current era, but the massive war machines called mechanical artillerists promise to be among the last. In war zones where magic is impossible, unreliable, or undesirable, mechanical artillerists are the undisputed juggernauts of the battlefield.

Mechanical artillerists are powered by tidy internal mechanisms that detonate controlled volumes of black powder at a steady clip. The volatile nature of its fuel tanks makes a compromised or destroyed artillerist nearly as dangerous as a fully operational one.

Although most commonly encountered in isolation, mechanical artillerists might group together in small squads. In such cases, the constructs usually each bear a few variations and are given specific combat roles, with one artillerist designated as the group's forward shield, one designated as the primary assault weapon, and one in the rear, loaded with a variety of long-range missiles.

## All Shapes and Sizes

In contrast to their uniform engines, artillerists' exteriors can vary wildly. Many mechanical artillerists resemble angular, metallic versions of animals such as crabs, bears, and sometimes even humans. Some might bear a single stripe of shell-spewing cannons, while others release gouts of fire from every side.
