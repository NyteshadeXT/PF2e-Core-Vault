The target takes 3d8 + 6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save). After rolling its save, the target can move 5 feet as a reaction to increase its save's degree of success by one step (from failure to success, for example). The creature must be able to spend a reaction to do this, and this movement triggers reactions as normal."

### Description
Often mistaken for incredibly beautiful elves, trodaiche-sidhes are a type of fey that participate in the wild hunt. With supernatural grace and lithe features, trodaiche-sidhes may be among the weakest of the wild hunt's supernatural stalkers and monster slayers, but they are still deadly in their own right, especially when encountered alongside their older and stronger kin. They serve as magnificent aides and attachés, deftly taking care of all the things that make a successful hunt possible. Duties range from sharpening weapons and oiling armor, crafting arrows, flushing game from bushes, and any other tasks that allow their superiors to focus entirely upon the hunt. Most of them do this only because they have been promised they will one day be invited to join the wild hunt proper, though how this process works—or how long a trodaiche-sidhe must endure being a servant—is not known.

Trodaiche-sidhes practice with all manner of arms and armor, though they are fond of elven weapons in particular. Even unarmed, a trodaiche-sidhe is more than a match for most mortals.

## The Wild Hunt

The wild hunt is a group of enigmatic fey who hunt prey across not only the fey realm, but across the entire multiverse. Among the wild hunt, trodaiche-sidhes are considered highly reliable squires.
