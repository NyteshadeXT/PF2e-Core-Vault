The shadow thief's body merges with that of the target, who must attempt a Will save. While merged, the target's shadow moves erratically, inflicting a -1 circumstance penalty to Make an Impression, Hide, or Sneak. The shadow thief cannot act while merged, except to Swap Shadows or Coalesce Memories or to end the merge by spending two actions, which have the concentrate trait. An affected creature can be identified by their shadow's oddities with a successful Occultism or Perception check.\nEffect: Penumbral Theft\n**Critical Success** The merge is unsuccessful.\n**Success** The shadow thief merges with the creature for 24 hours.\n**Failure** The shadow thief merges with the creature indefinitely."

### Description
One of the many creations of the unfathomable denizens of the distant cosmos, shadow thieves are small creatures with strangely angular bodies that lie underneath a veil of shadow. Despite the aura of dusk that perpetually surrounds them, shadow thieves are corporeal and remain as such even when they merge with a mortal creature to steal the mortal's shadow.

Shadow thieves were initially created to gather information for their alien masters. By assuming the form of different mortal creatures' shadows, a shadow thief could infiltrate society via progressively more important figures. At least, this was their creators' intention. However, as the first shadow thieves traveled through the vastness of space, they lost their connection to their elder creators—but not their interest in the societies of mortals. Now they wander the planet with their own mysterious designs in mind.

## Willing Hosts

The experience of having one's shadow stolen by a shadow thief is not pleasant—but stories exist of mortals who form friendships with shadow thieves, willingly allowing the monsters to accompany them on their journeys. For unwilling hosts, the easiest way to rid oneself of a shadow thief is to offer the being a tantalizing morsel of knowledge.
