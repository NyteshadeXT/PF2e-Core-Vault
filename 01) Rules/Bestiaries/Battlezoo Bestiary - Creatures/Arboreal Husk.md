### Description
Arboreal husks typically manifest from arboreal wardens, regents, and other arboreals who fail to protect their forest wards from evil depredations. These brokenhearted, twisted guardians of the trees go on to sow the same kinds of despair they felt upon seeing their home so ravaged.

Whereas most arboreals attack only creatures whose aims are incompatible with the prosperity of the forest, such as loggers and invading warmongers, arboreal husks are not so picky when it comes to choosing foes. To these husks, all living creatures are potential despoilers of nature, from an elven druid "experimenting" on plants with her nourishing primal magic to the lowly squirrel "stealing" acorns for the winter. No amount of reason or charm can sway an arboreal husk from the basic assumption that anyone in its vicinity means harm to it and its ruined domain.

Some arboreals have tried to revert their disturbed husk relatives to their original goodly natures, though so far none have succeeded. An arboreal husk rooted in a healthy forest doesn't recoverâ€”in fact, the opposite occurs, as the forest around the husk wilts and dies in its ruinous presence. Thus, untainted arboreals have no choice but to slay their twisted siblings. Rather than hunt down and destroy known husks in their territory, arboreals often choose to hire adventurers to take on this terrible task.

The arboreal husk presented here is of an arboreal regent.

## Guardians of Nothing

If an arboreal is typically the guardian of a forest, then what do arboreal husks protect? The answer is at the root of the existential crisis that causes such husks to exist in the first place: nothing. Some woodland sages insist that all husks, including arboreal husks, can be redeemed if placed within a flourishing natural realm. But husks themselves blanch at the thought and seem to revel in their despair. If there is any validity to this claim, then the act of transplanting a husk into a new home must be undertaken necessarily by force.

## Husk

Plant creatures share a special bond with the natural world that few other beings can completely understand or appreciate. When the bond to its realm is broken or severed, a sentient plant creature's rage can transform it into a terrible shadow of its former self. Benign and even friendly plants like leshies, arboreals, and dryads all run the risk of this horrible metamorphosis, though their own agony often pales in comparison to the horrors which they inflict on their victims. Lonely, angry, and twisted, plant husks sow their monstrous madness in the fertile corpses of wanderers who dare travel through the husk's blighted swath of wilderness. Though in their eyes any living creature is worthy of obliteration, husks reserve their most horrendous punishments for any litterer, land settler, or lumberjack who ever dared to desecrate, dominate, or denude the forest.
