Using Grab extends the duration of the monster's Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it."

### Description
Known for their supernatural grace, vicious brutality, and shimmering silver-blue fur, phase tigers are dangerous magical predators who stalk the boundaries between the Ethereal and Material Planes.

Many regard phase tigers as myth rather than fact, which is just fine for the planes-hopping hunters who make their fortunes on the pelts of these incredible animals. For their part, phase tigers have their own natural enemies, or, at least, their own favored prey. Chief among phase tigers' ancestral foes are blink dogs, whom phase tigers disdain both for their inherent "goodness" (which the tigers regard as weakness disguised as chivalry) and for their tendency to help other creatures in need. A phase tiger is happy to track down and tear apart an entire pack of blink dogs in any place and at any time, if only for the sheer sport of it.

## Phase Tiger Pelts

Only the wealthiest aristocrats and the most skilled hunters should even dream of getting their hands on a phase tiger pelt. Phase tigers are as rare in the wilds as they are formidable in combat, to say nothing of their reputations for wanton cruelty and vileness. Even in cities where fur-collecting is seen as gauche or morally reprehensible, an exception is made for the skins of irredeemably evil phase tigers.
