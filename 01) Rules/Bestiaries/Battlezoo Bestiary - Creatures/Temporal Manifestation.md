This temporal pocket has no dimensions, so the temporal manifestation can fit any number of Medium or smaller creatures within itself.\nTime does not function normally within the temporal pocket. Each round at the beginning of its turn, a swallowed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save; on a failure, the creature is Slowed 2 that round instead of Slowed 1. Creatures who suffocate within the temporal pocket do not die, but rather remain Unconscious in a kind of stasis, never aging, until the temporal manifestation is destroyed or another trapped creature ruptures the temporal manifestation. Once the temporal manifestation ruptures, all creatures in the pocket dimension fall out; unconscious creatures regain consciousness but are Sickened 1 from the sudden shift in the laws of time.\n"

### Description
When something or someone moves from one point in time and space to another, such as through summoning or teleportation, the magical energy expended in the process isn't always transferred properly. Sometimes, an excess of energy is left in one reality and a void is left in the other. Such unbalanced energies can materialize as a temporal manifestation—a shadowy void being who defies the laws of time and space.

Temporal manifestations appear as roughly humanoid-shaped voids filled with images of the night sky. Upon closer examination, one can see that the images are that of time moving in all directions at once: stars dying and being reborn, galaxies expanding and collapsing, universes forming from a singularity then dissipating into a cold, lifeless, dark ending. Those who get too close to a temporal manifestation can utterly lose themselves as they stare at such a pure expression of time.

## Unknowable Plans

Temporal manifestations have their own inscrutable agendas—agendas that rarely bode well for mortals and other creatures from the Material Plane.
