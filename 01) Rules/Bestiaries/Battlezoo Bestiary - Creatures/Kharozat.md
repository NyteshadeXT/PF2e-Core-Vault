### Description
The kharozats were once the highest judges in a long-forgotten empire—magistrates tasked with trying and sentencing the most heinous criminals throughout the land. Now, few kharozats remain on the Material Plane, and those that do dwell in the lightless hearts of underground caverns or in the most god-forsaken corners of the mortal world—places where they believe their merciless rulings are most needed.

Whatever domain it calls its jurisdiction, a kharozat maintains order with stern practicality, declaring judgment and enacting whatever sentences it considers to be appropriate. The infernal judge fixates its attention on one "trial" at a time, bringing an entire kingdom or a single individual through a twisted jurisprudence. When establishing its courtroom, a kharozat recruits a variety of fiendish creatures as stenographers, bailiffs, clerks, counselors, executioners, and jurors.

## Faces of Justice

Roughly humanoid in form, every kharozat has three masked faces, each representing a different aspect of the adjudication process and a corresponding alignment: judge (lawful neutral), prosecutor (lawful evil), and executioner (chaotic evil)
