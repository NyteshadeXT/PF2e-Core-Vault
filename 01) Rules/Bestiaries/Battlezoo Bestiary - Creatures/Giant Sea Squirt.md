### Description
These ovoid, translucent filter-feeders have markings that resemble a bleach- white skull and ribcage. Although sea squirts (known more formally as ascidians) usually pose no more threat than a loofah, some species—such as the infamous "death's head" variety—can deliver painful stings or even pose a mortal threat to coastal swimmers and reef explorers.

Particularly among the crowded coral reefs they call home, the skeleton image on a giant sea squirt's mostly transparent body provides natural and effective camouflage. In addition, the skull and ribcage markings serve as a rudimentary nervous system, allowing them to perceive the aquatic world immediately around them, even despite their nonexistent vision or even a brain.

A giant sea squirt's size is dictated by its diet; those intelligent species that use sea squirts as indiscriminate waste disposal systems may find their living trash compactors grown to a size that they become a threat to the unwary. Animals as large as full-grown sharks have been found paralyzed, drowned, and slowly digesting in a sea squirt's gut.

## Sea Squirt Gardens

Some aquatic species that worship death or the cycle of life hold these creatures in high regard and cultivate whole gardens of them. Certain merfolk and culdewen societies predisposed to necromancy, for example, find death's head sea squirts to be quite beautiful—not to mention helpful in trapping animals and intruders.
