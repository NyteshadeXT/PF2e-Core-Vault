### Description
Found only in the depths of the most primordial forests, the coquecigrue is a bizarre creature that twists the minds of those who see or hear it. The forest for miles around a coquecigrue's lair is littered with the bodies of the creature's previous victims, many of whom went violently insane after their fateful encounter with this strange avian monster.

The coquecigrue is as bizarre to describe as it is to behold. It is said to have the head and legs of a twisted, fiendish rooster; a long, serpentine neck; and a bloated body covered in feathers that constantly and impossibly change colors. The monster's weakness is plain: Its green heart glows visibly from beneath its translucent breast, and those who know to strike this vital organ can deal massive damage. It is from this heart that the coquecigrue's most terrifying powers come from, including a soft, distorted tone that the coquecigrue can turn into a madness-inducing warble as it likes.

So far, no one has been able to slay a coquecigrue and return to civilization with its body. Even the number of these creatures is up for debate, since no two have been sighted together. Few reasonable people believe the outlandish reports of those who claim to have encountered even just one coquecigrue.

## Bizarre Origins

The original coquecigrue was supposedly a child of one of the Great Old Ones, which became warped and twisted as it emerged on the Material Plane through a prismatic wall. Few believe this nonsensical origin story, though those who have faced a coquecigrue and lived to tell the tale aren't so quick to discount it.
