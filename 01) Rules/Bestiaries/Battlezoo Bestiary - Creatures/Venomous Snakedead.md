### Description
Venomous snakedead are horrific creatures created through vile arcane means during which the sacrificial victim—always a sentient, humanoid creature—is bitten numerous times by poisonous snakes. All the while, dark incantations are chanted and snake blood is poured onto the sacrifice's lacerations. These rites strip the creature of its sentience and transform it into a mindless abomination.

A venomous snakedead retains its humanoid body but shows clear signs of its fate. Its body is covered in bite marks and its veins swell with stagnant black, green, and purple fluids. The eyes of a venomous snakedead have a similarly black, green, or purple hue to them. Its mouth sports fangs dripping with venom, but most telling of all is the creature's sinewy neck, lengthened in the process of the creation rites and imbued with necromantic strength.

While a venomous snakedead is a mindless creature and, as such, does not have a sense of society, the arcane magic used to create it binds the creature to others of its kind. If its creator is killed or willingly releases the venomous snakedead, it will naturally be drawn to other snakedead. It is not unheard of for venomous snakedead to gather in large groups or even hordes, and witnesses of such phenomena speak of the beings' hivemind-like behavior and the display of their own unique profane rituals. What, exactly, these rituals accomplish is anyone's guess.

It is said that venomous snakedead were first created by a coven of witches serving strange serpentine demons. The witches sought to create a creature in their patrons' image, a creature that would do the witches' bidding in the mortal realm. They were more successful than they had dared hope, for the snakedead shared a mystical connection not only with the divine, but with other snakedead. Realizing the untapped potential of this link between snakedead to spread their demonic overlords' message, the witches spread the means of creating snakedead to other wizards and necromancers throughout the land, allowing their snakedead creations to gather together and wreak death upon the world.

## Venomous Snakedead Locations

Venomous snakedead are more common in places where snakes are held in high regard and humanoids are not. Underground cities, desert temples, and jungle towers might all host these foul creatures, whether as sadists' slaves, pharaohs' servants, or wizards' guardians.
