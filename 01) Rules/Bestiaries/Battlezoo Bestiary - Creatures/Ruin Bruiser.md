### Description
Ruin bruisers are stony agents of entropyâ€”stout constructs made of heavy marble inlaid with bands of bronze, whose sole aims are to expedite the natural deterioration of architecture and items in ancient and abandoned castles, dungeons, and vaults. They are patient and methodical in this goal, as it can take a group of ruin bruisers months or years to erode and erase the last specks of a particular fortress or stronghold.

Ruin bruisers resemble suits of animated ceremonial full plate armor made of marble, inlaid with bronze. The ornate designs are caked with grime and worn with age. A dull red glow emanates from within the joints of the armor, and large, ovular eyes glow golden from beneath the full helm. They carry marble shields, banded with iron and bearing symbols of forgotten meaning.

Ruin bruisers typically appear in groups of up to a half dozen in old underground locations, such as remote dungeons and forgotten tombs. They use their decaying touch to crumble worked stone and wood, destroy traps and passages, and cause tools and weapons to rust away. Any magical items or artifacts which resist ruin bruisers' powers wind up in deep holes the bruisers dig under the place's foundation specifically to hide such things. Many adventurers have spent their entire lives scouring locations effaced by ruin bruisers in the hopes of finding one of these treasure-filled chasms. For their part, ruin bruisers tend to ignore living creatures, only attacking in self-defense or as necessary to continue their mission. Canny treasure hunters can take advantage of a site being dismantled by ruin bruisers, as traps may no longer function, guardians creatures may have been dealt with, and treasure may already be consolidated into a neat pile.

## Erasing Tracks

The first ruin bruisers were created by a group of vile dwarven witches who, tired of living on the outskirts of civilization, sought to integrate themselves into nearby towns and cities. They created ruin bruisers to systematically destroy their former hideouts, fortresses, and dungeons, which had become too numerous to remember and contained equally innumerable evidence tying the witches to their foul deeds. That was long ago, however; since then, ruin bruisers have spread far beyond the mountains from which they originated.
