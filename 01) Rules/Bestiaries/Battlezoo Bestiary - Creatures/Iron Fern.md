### Description
Iron ferns are metallic fronded plants that grow in mine shafts, along cave walls, and atop rock formations. In its bud form, an iron fern secretes an acid that dissolves stone and earth, allowing the plant's roots to sup upon the exposed trace minerals and ores. As the bud sprouts its first fiddlehead, its leaves become coated in whatever metal it has absorbed, forming a kind of protective sheath around the soft plant matter. Because there are as many different types of iron fern as there are metals, the plant's name is something of a misnomer; the most common varieties of iron fern are, in fact, copper, tin, and nickel ferns. Conversely, rare varieties such as gold and platinum ferns are highly prized among botanists and treasure hunters alike.

However, iron ferns are as hazardous as they are valuable. The plant's hormones are similar to a flytrap, allowing it to mindlessly swat at would-be predators with its razor-sharp leaves. Miners and spelunkers take great care in caves populated by iron ferns; serrated metal leaves can drop from tunnel ceilings onto unsuspecting workers or slash at their feet from within cracked rock faces. Some mining companies employ specially trained rust monsters to clear out iron ferns in advance, though the dangers of a well-fed rust monster are only slightly less daunting than those of an iron fern forest.

Like other ferns, iron ferns reproduce via spores. However, iron ferns' spores are no mundane plant matter. Rather, these spores manifest as clouds of metal shavings extremely dangerous to the eyes and lungs of any creature unlucky enough to wander by. Conveniently for the iron fern, the corpse of a spore-slain animal makes for an extremely fertile germination medium.

As mindless plants, iron ferns are incapable of ill will, though this doesn't stop many living creatures from openly despising these ferrous flora. For those willing to risk a few cuts, though, iron ferns promise many potential riches, from mundane animal hides to spilled gold and magic items.

## Lucky Leaf

Despite their dangerous leaves and spores, iron ferns are often regarded as a sign of good luck, particularly when sighted outside of a mine or cave. The presence of this plant, so the thinking goes, indicates that rich metal veins may be hidden just beneath the earth's surface.
