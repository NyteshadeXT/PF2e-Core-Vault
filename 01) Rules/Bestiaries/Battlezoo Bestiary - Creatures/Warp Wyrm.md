### Description
Warp wyrms are small drakes capable of rapidly teleporting between the Ethereal and Material Planes, upon both of which they wreak incredible amounts of damage wherever they go. Whereas most drakes are at least prone to stay near their natural environs, warp wyrms know no such boundaries, making them a deadly menace in lands far and wide.

Whereas most drake collectives are known as rampages, a gang of warp wyrms is called a chaos, and rightly so, for few groups of monsters exhibit as much wanton mayhem and destructive curiosity as these cruel dragons. Even when a warp wyrm lacks prey with which to play, it will undoubtedly stick its nose in all manner of nooks and crannies, uncovering things that should remain hidden, releasing things that should be contained, and breaking things that are impossible to fix.

## Sadistic Predators

Warp wyrms are smaller than most drakes, but no less vicious. Like cats or sadists, warp wyrms delight in playing with their victims before making the killing blow. Nothing gets a warp wyrm howling with laughter quite like leaping out of the Ethereal Plane to scare a victim or knocking prey through a dimensional portal toward its terrible demise.
