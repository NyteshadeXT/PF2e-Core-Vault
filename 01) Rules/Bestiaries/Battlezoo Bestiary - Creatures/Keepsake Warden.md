A keepsake warden can spend 10 minutes concentrating on an item of light or negligible Bulk to designate it as a keepsake item. A keepsake warden can designate up to three such keepsake items, which it can carry on its person or leave elsewhere. The supernatural connection between a keepsake warden and its keepsake items is severed only when a keepsake item is broken or destroyed. Scrying and similar spells cast on a keepsake warden allow the caster to also simultaneously spy on the warden's keepsake items."

### Description
Keepsake wardens are solitary watchers over Purgatory, cemeteries, and anywhere they can rob the graves of the forgotten to harness their strange necromantic powers. Although they commonly dwell among undead such as ghouls, skeletons, and zombies, keepsake wardens are themselves mortal—a fact which they feverishly deny and try to hide from would-be giant slayers.

Skulking between tombstones on moonlit nights, keepsake wardens do an excellent job of blending into their dour surroundings. To further the impression that they dwell in the twilit space between life and death, they outfit themselves in the trappings of the dead—jewels, hides, tokens, and bones—and seem always to bear the sweet, pungent odors of incense and decay. Their flesh ranges from deep burgundy to ashen gray, and their hair is typically a black or brown color. A keepsake warden always keeps a tool for excavation close at hand—preferably something that can double as a deadly weapon in combat.

A typical keepsake warden stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,700 pounds.

## Scattered Treasures

A keepsake warden that has settled on a particular cemetery tends to keep one of its precious keepsake items on its person but spread its other treasures across the graveyard's grounds. This grants the giant some measure of safety as it wanders its lonely territory. However, should adventurers or grave robbers abscond with a keepsake item, knowingly or unknowingly, the keepsake warden is quick to fly into a rage until it reclaims its lost trinket.
