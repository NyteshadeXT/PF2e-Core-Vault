### Description
Rumor has it the first skeletal monstrosity was a red dragon who was interrupted during her ritual to become a ravener. The resulting calamity left the once- dragon weak and monstrous, a mockery of her former might and a far cry from her aspirations as an undead tyrant. She was grounded in her new, terrible form, stripped of her intellect and magic, and cursed to walk the world until merciful destruction released her soul once and for all.

While there is plenty of truth to this tale, necromancers, evil clerics, and other harbingers of undeath more often create their own versions of these brutish horrors. Because collecting the bones of a dragon is impractical (to say the least), such crafters typically scrape together the bones of multiple smaller creatures, then glue them together with resin or magic before animating the monstrosity. Tyrannosauruses and other large dinosaurs are popular bases to work from. The crafter can then take the bones of smaller animals, sharpen them, and fasten them around the dinosaur skeleton to create jagged spines, extra tails, bladed elbows, or "wing scythes."

## Bone Spitters

Skeletal monstrosities can fling their very bones at foes, either sending a single large rib slicing through the air or exhaling a violent blast of fine bone shards. Because they are able to consume other creatures' bones and incorporate them into their own bodies, skeletal monstrosities never lack ammunition.
