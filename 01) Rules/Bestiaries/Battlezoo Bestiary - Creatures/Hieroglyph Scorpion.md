### Description
Hieroglyph scorpions are magical vermin originally constructed to guard pharaonic mausoleums, temples, and pyramids. Their unique ability to blend in with painted murals, chiseled inscriptions, and ornate sarcophagi allow them to tail tomb-robbers unseen, then leap out, attack, and disable would-be thieves.

These incorporeal scorpions boast mighty defenses as their incomplete materialization allows them to flatten out and patrol two-dimensional surfaces. With long stingers and pincers, hieroglyph scorpions tend to keep their opponents at a distance, and are not above retreating from a lost fight.

The hieroglyph scorpion's most fearsome weapon is its inscription venom, which gradually turns its victims to stone and adds them to the scorpion's ever-denser mural. But there is opportunity in danger. The halls protected by ancient hieroglyph scorpions are inscribed with countless unlucky treasure hunters. Destroying the mural could free themâ€”and their loot.

## Constructed Spirit

Though it lacks a physical body and has the incorporeal trait, a hieroglyph scorpion is not undead. Instead, it is a constructed being made from inanimate ethereal quintessence. Nevertheless, the powerful magic that creates a hieroglyph scorpion also binds it to the walls of the tomb it is ordered with protecting, enabling it to "rejuvenate" similarly to the way a ghost does.
