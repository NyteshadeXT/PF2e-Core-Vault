### Description
In the last desperate days of a civilization, even heroes can fall. The ancient manipulators of humankind, known as aboleths, took advantage of this discord to create so-called "lost saviors." These undead are perversions of former heroes who foolishly attempted to negotiate a covenant with the dread abolethsâ€”the outcome of a truly desperate bargain made in the hopes of salvation for the hero's people. Aboleths are nothing if not treacherous, and the deal resulted only in the defiling and dishonor of so many former champions.

Lost saviors wander storm-torn coastlines and remote hinterlands in a haze, unsure of their mission but compelled to sow sorrow all the same. They sometimes travel with other intelligent undead or, occasionally, weak aboleth agents. Under the guise of their former selves, lost saviors might look like heroic figures from folklore or simply glorious and righteous fighters. This makes it all the more painful and horrifying for onlookers when the lost savior reveals its true form. The revelation is invariably followed by a merciless onslaught.

## Corrupters of Society

When a lost savior infiltrates a society, it can rile the populace into a chaotic frenzy under the banner of its false guise. Using powerful illusions and enchantments, a lost savior insurrectionist can bend an entire settlement or even nation to its unknowable masters' will before revealing its true monstrous allegiance. By this point, it is too late for the community to do anything but quake in fear.
