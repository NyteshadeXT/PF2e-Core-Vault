### Description
Yomhibdis are information-devouring abominations that resemble floating humanoids made of ink-scrawled words, phrases, and symbols. They manifest on the Ethereal Plane from the wasted ink and squandered emotional energies of artists, poets, and writers who give up on works before they're finished. As soon as it manifests, a yomhibdi begins its never-ending search for the failed or self-sabotaging creatives on whom it feeds. Frustration, exhaustion, and despair are the yomhibdi's favorite dishes; once it has sapped a victim of these negative emotions, the yomhibdi consumes the creator whole.

The words and sentences that compose a yomhibdi typically twist together into a roughly humanoid shape, since humanoids are the most common providers of the emotions that lead to a yomhibdi's creation. They typically stand about 5 feet tall but weigh less than 20 pounds, though they can reconfigure their bodies to a certain extent, lengthening their inky "claws" to strike at distant foes.

Yomhibdis trapped on the Material Plane gravitate toward places of learning, art, and culture—anywhere that hacks and untalented creators might congregate. It is not unusual for a group of yomhibdis (called a story) to make their lair in the hidden nook of an old library or in the tunnels beneath great opera houses and theaters. There, they blend into the shadows and lie in ambush, ready to strike at any agonizing poets or playwrights who wander by lost in thought. As echoes of forgotten thoughts and stories, these creatures commonly steal works of writing from their victims, and their lairs might contain valuable books or even magic scrolls.

## Creative Reliance

Yomhibdi exists solely to feed on the negative emotions of creative mortals. If it is unable to find a source of sustenance—such as in wilderness or hyper-pragmatic societies that don't foster creativity—a yomhibdi will gradually unspool and melt into a puddle of ink.
