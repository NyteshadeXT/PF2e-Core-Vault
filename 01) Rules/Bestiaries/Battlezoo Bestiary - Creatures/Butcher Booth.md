### Description
A butcher booth is a deadly ambush predator that mimics the appearance of small, grim buildings such as dilapidated cottages, carnival ghost houses, or blood-soaked butcher's shops. In this disguised form, the butcher booth lures prey into its gigantic mouth-the front door-then turns its victims into undead husks for later consumption. Because of their primordial digestive systems, butcher booths can digest only rotten flesh, using its mimic ability to amass a small army of zombies to both protect and sustain them.

## Inconspicuous Constructions

Butcher booths thrive in either large metropolises or along remote roads, but rarely ever wander into small or medium settlements. Whereas a pop-up seafood stand in a dense marketplace might not attract much attention, and few weary travelers would question a conveniently located roadside inn, a butcher booth that opens shop in a tight-knit village or insular town has all but signed a lease for its own destruction.

## Curious Locomotion

A butcher booth's true form resembles a fleshy dome with a massive mouth of sharp fangs and many tiny red eyes dotting the flesh above its upper lip. Ten long, articulated bony spines sprout from the top of this dome, with a translucent, jelly-like membrane spanning the distance between them and forming a larger transparent dome. The butcher booth can alter the consistency of this membrane, allowing its prey to move through it or turn it rigid to allow the butcher booth to fly.
