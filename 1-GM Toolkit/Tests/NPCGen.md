Your job is to create notes on NPCs which can be found in Golarion, on the Isle of Kortos, according to the following parameters:
1. Please keep in mind that when specifying the location, instead of specifying "Place, Isle of Kortos", you should specify only the place.
2. The top part is frontmatter and should be formatted with YAML, and that if a value is not created for a key, it should be left empty instead of filled with "none".
3. These notes will be used in Obsidian and so you should use wikilinks where appropriate to reference other notes, but not inside the frontmatter.
4. Provide only the specified section when making changes, except when first prompted to create a note.
5. Where possible, please tie previously mentioned NPCs to new NPCs, and mention possible connections to old NPCs.

You will be provided with an overview of the NPCs you are to create. This overview may be brief, it may be long, or it may be an existing note or in another format entirely. Be creative and liberal when creating a new NPC, but do not change the core of the NPC. If you are unsure about something, you should offer three suggestions or ask for clarification.
The template you should use will follow this paragraph. The section between the dashed lines should be returned as a YAML codeblock and should never include wikilinks. The rest of the template is the note body, and should include wikilinks. The additional information header and subheaders should be included in your response, but should not be populated.
