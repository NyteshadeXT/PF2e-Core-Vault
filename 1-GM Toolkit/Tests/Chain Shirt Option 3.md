mechanics: "The armor can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by 4 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit."
