description: "Iron strips line the body of an accursed staff, capping the bottom and folding into an intricate knot at the top. While wielding an accursed staff, you’re empowered by the curses you inflict. If an enemy fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that has the curse trait, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell’s level. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes. The enemy must be a significant threat and can’t have been a willing subject of the curse."
