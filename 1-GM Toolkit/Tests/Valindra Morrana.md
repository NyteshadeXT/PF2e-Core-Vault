## Featured in Campaign

When the party first arrived in [[Beehill]] they took contact with Valindra to report the kidnapping of Syndra. During [[Session 0 - The Golem Awakes|Session 0]], on the information from the party, she carried out the mass arrest against the [[Redbrands]], who later fled during [[The Golem]]-attack. She led the defense of the city against [[The Golem]].

### S03 - S04
Around noon on the 6<sup>th</sup> of Kythorn 12 heavily armored guards and two carriages with supply arrive in the village helmed by general [[Ryann Maus | Colonel Ryann Maus]]. Valindra was not impressed with the meager response but bit her lips. She soon got to learn that Colonel Maus is a pure douchebag.

When the party returned back in [[Beehill]] in [[Session 3 - Shopping & Networking|Session 3]], Valindra introduced the party as a group of contracted mercenaries on the village payroll, but due to the strained situation she hadn't been able to pay them fully. She said that they are owed ü™ô<font color="#D8B800">100gp each</font>, Although Maus only paid them ü™ô<font color="#D8B800">250gp</font> for *'a job half-done'*. Valindra took the party aside and asked them for details on what they had accomplished. She implored them to do something about the situation, because the sooner they could go back to normal, the sooner she could get rid of the Colonel.

She mentioned in passing that [[Dendar Family | a woodcarver family]] where kidnapped yesterday, and it seems that the [[Redbrands]] where behind it.

When the party arrived with beheaded body of [[Tommy and Willis | Tommy]] and the other dead or unconscious bodies of redbrands in the evening of the 6<sup>th</sup> of Kythorn. Valindra was put in a difficult position and had to arrest [[Mithyra Vriss Forthoc|Mithyra]] and [[Azgragor Virkan|Azgragor]]. However, in the wee hours of the morning the next day, she and [[Ryann Maus|Colonel Maus]] were approached by a spy from The Crown, who ordered to them to release the party members. So they acted on this. In the forenoon of the 7<sup>th</sup>, she got a short anonymous message from [[Clarissa Bumbleleaf|Clarissa]] informing her about the secret entrance to the [[Harding Estate]] cellar and that [[Redbrands]] had been seen there. She replied in kind that she would try to investigate, but that it would be hard to shake the glearing eyes of Maus.
