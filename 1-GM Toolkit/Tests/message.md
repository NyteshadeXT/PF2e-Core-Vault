##### Entering the Temple

> [!column | 3 no-t]
>> [!danger | bg-c-blue] The Front Gates
>> This is the most obvious, but heavily fortified route. It requires overcoming both physical obstacles and deception-based traps.
>> * To open the doors, it needs a ==DC 20 strength group check==. (Opens inwards)
>> * The doors can also be passed by using a spell such as [[Dimension door]], [[Passwall]], [[Disintegrate]] or similar. Since the door isn't stuck itself or barred or locked, [[Knock]] doesn't aid.
>> * If the frost giants have been convinced to help, they can open the door, triggering the collapse trap on the inside.
>> 
>>> [!cite | bg-c-green]- The Antechamber
>>> *Since you last past through here, a huge pile of rubble, mortar and bricks have been moved here, at first glance in an attempt to block the doors. Presumably the kobolds are using their own tunnels to get in and out and do not want unwelcome guest moving either way. Among the rubble you see the odd wooden door and pews jammed into the pile, and rope strewn across the chamber. As you've entered the chamber, you find yourself on top a larger stone slab resting at an angle.*
>> 
>> **Ceiling trap.** (==Investigation DC 16==) Immediately inside the antechamber, rubble has been pilled up to help bar the door. Several slabs of rubble have been jerry-rigged to wobble (==Acrobatics DC 15==) that would tout ropes connected to a hidden wedge in columns along the walls, that would then shift and break mortar at the its top, triggering large slabs in the ceiling to come loose and sending down a shower of bricks and mortar. ==Dex Save DC 18== `dice: 8d10` (8d10) bludgeoning damage and [[Restrained]] (==Athletics DC 20==) on a failed check, `dice: 4d10` (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a successful check.
>>
>> **Illusion Trap.** (==Investigation DC 15==) In the doorways leading out of the antechamber, illusion glyphs (==Arcana DC 18==) that flares purple upon activation and spawns four illusionary archer kobolds  that start taking potshots at the party from behind columns in the main hall (==Investigation DC 15==).
>
>> [!danger | bg-c-orange] The Kobold Tunnels
>> The koboldsâ€™ tunnels provide a stealthy approach but force the party into tight spaces and unknown exits.
>> * To find the tunnels under the snow requires a ==DC 25 Survival check==, as the kobolds very rarely use them to go outside.
>> * If a party member later on falls of the roof trying to climb it, they have a 5% chance of falling into the opening of a tunnel.
>> 
>>> [!cite | bg-c-green]- Crawling through the tunnels
>>> *The tunnel is very small, and it becomes clear to you that the kobolds probably run through these passages on all for or themselves walking with hunched backs. For you all, who are quite tall, this means that you have to crawl, and even so, the rough hewed tunnel walls comes in close at points, forcing you to drag yourself forward. You utter a silent prayer that you won't run into any kobolds traveling the other way, because fighting here would be close to impossible.*

>> [!danger | bg-c-purple] Climbing the Roof
>> *See: [[Climbing, Swimming, Crawling#Variant Rule Climbing using a rope | Climbing using a rope]]*
>> Each party member needs **3** net successes to climb the roof. **Loose initiative.** Each attempt at advancing requires a ==Athletics DC 18 check==. On a failure, Roll on the consequence table:

>> * ==Arcana DC 18== reveals that the net will discharge effectively a [[Lightning Bolt]] spell.
>> * Trying to cut or touching the net will shock the attacker (==Dex save DC 13==) for `dice: 8d6` (8d6) lightning damage.
>> * [[Dispel Magic]] or [[Antimagic Field]] can deal with the net. if they can pass through the tiny netting of the field that can also surpass it.
