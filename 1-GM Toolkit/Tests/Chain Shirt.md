description: "Sometimes called a hauberk, this is a long shirt constructed of the same metal rings as chainmail. However, it is much lighter than chainmail and protects only the torso, upper arms, and upper legs of its wearer."
mechanics: "**Armor Specialization Effect (Chain)** The armor can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by 4 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit."
