## Overview

> [!kirk|info] Prompt (Remove me)
> The Dungeon Seekers Guild stands as a beacon for those who crave adventure, seek forgotten knowledge, and thrive in the heart of danger. Their banners flutter across continents, and their name echoes through taverns and royal courts alike.
> 
> The guild's primary purpose is to explore dungeons in any of their various forms; subterranean labyrinths, cursed crypts, and forgotten temples.  They seek to uncover relics, unravel magical mysteries, and reclaim Creature Cores from defeated foes and even Dungeon Cores when necessary or required. Dungeon Seekers vie for fame. Their deeds are sung in taverns, etched on stone tablets, and whispered by bards. Fortune follows—the spoils of war, artifacts, and contracts from wealthy patrons. The Dungeon Seekers guild works has an excellent relationship with [[Arcane Exchange Consortium]] and the two are regular partners.
> 
> Amongst the leaders of the Dungeon Seekers guild are:
> - Guildmaster [[Belegar Cragstone]]: A grizzled dwarf with a runic hammer. His beard holds tales of countless dungeons. Belegar assigns quests, negotiates contracts, and ensures the guild's survival.
> - [[Nadria the Core Whisperer]]: A mysterious sorceress who senses Creature Cores. Her eyes glow when near hidden treasures. Nadria deciphers ancient runes, unlocking dungeon secrets.
> - Captain [[Riven Stormblade]]:  Head of the guilds peacekeeping forces.  A swashbuckling rogue who leads particularly dangers or high-profile dungeon expeditions. His cutlass has tasted the blood of many guardians. Riven's charisma rallies the guild, and his map-making skills guide them through perilous mazes.
> 
> Members of the Dungeon Seekers guild have several perks.  Dungeon Delving Contracts are the primary form of income for the guild.  Nobles, scholars, and factions hire the guild to explore specific dungeons. They seek artifacts, forbidden knowledge, or strategic advantages. The guild negotiates fees, shares, and exclusivity rights.  Creature Core Retrieval is the second major income source.  Guild members specialize in reclaiming Creature Cores from defeated monsters. These cores fuel magic item creation and spellcasting allowing guild members access to a wide array of items and crafters.  The guild's alchemists refine the cores into elixirs, potions, and magical tonics.  The Dungeon Seekers guild also provides training and mentorship so that novices who join the guild receive proper training. They learn trap detection, combat tactics, and deciphering ancient scripts. Experienced Seekers mentor them, sharing battle scars and wisdom.
> 
> The Dungeon Seekers guild is not without its own mysteries.  Whispers persist that a dungeon exists where the wind itself guards a Dungeon treasure vault, The Lost Vault of Zephyrion. The Seekers hunt for its location as the legend says the vault contains the source of the treasure which are mysteriously found in Dungeons.   Some claim that a legendary Seeker, known as the Phantom Seeker, roams between worlds—a ghostly figure who appears in dire moments. The Phantom Seeker guides lost seekers, vanishing when their purpose is fulfilled.
