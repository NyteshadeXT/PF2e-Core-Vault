## History
Lazare was a dragonchess champion in Ardentia City some 20 years ago, and used ample winnings gained there to purchase a mine in the area surrounding Diamond Lake.  He and his family moved to the village and a new life as a mine manager, but failed to anticipate the desperate, appalling politics of the mud-soaked mining town.  WIthin three years, Lazare was all but bankrupted, forced to sell his mine to Balbar Smenk (whom the usually serene chessmaster still hates with undisguised passion).  

## Notes
Lazare blames Smenk for the death of his beloved wife, who grew gravely ill at the height of the ownership struggle.  He cherishes his daughter, Dannath, who reminds him of his lost love and the stakes of Diamond Lake politics.

Lazare swiftly allies himself with anyone who makes an overt move against Balabar Smenk, but he does so cautiously and without fan fare.  He summons them to his parlor for a private audience, during which he attempts to gauge their abilities and reasons for moving against Smenk.  IF his attitude is changed from friendly to helpful during this encounter, Lazare contacts them a week later and again summons them to his establishment.  This time he cakes them on a circuit of the gaming alcoves, where he introduces them to Gansworth and Parrin.  The female mine manager stays silent during the encounter, but Gansworth challenges one of the PCs to a game of dragonchess. If the PC manages to beath him he invites the group to his restaurant, the Rusty Bucket to propose a formal alliance.
