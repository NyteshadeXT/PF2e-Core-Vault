## Current Events
Smenk is secretly in league with [[The Ebon Triad]]. He currently provides the Triad cultists with food and supplies that the Triad's agents pick up in town.  Unfortunately, Balabar's arrogance got the better of him.  Since the Triad is a captive market, he has taken to selling them spoiled food, poor quality tools and other goods at outrageous prices.  Furthermore, in his last meeting with the Triad he hinted that he might need regular bribes to keep him quiet.  Balabar's confidence recieved a crushing blow when he woke up next to the ssevered head of his right-hand man planted in his bed by grimlock scouts dispatched to send Balabar a warning.  Smenk now knows that he overplayed his hand and he wants [[The Ebon Triad]] destroyed.
