## Overview
Somebody’s moved into the Old Observatory. I saw a crew of Balabar Smenk’s boys hauling all kinds of unusual contraptions and gear from a carriage parked outside the building. Heavy cloth sheets covered just about everything, but I could have sworn that some of the things they unloaded were huge glass tanks. 

### Details
A handful of miners saw Kullen and his gang moving the necromancer Filge into the Old Observatory, a key location in [[The Whispering Cairn]].
