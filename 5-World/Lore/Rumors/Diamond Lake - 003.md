## Overview
Did you hear about what happened at the Spinning Giant last month? There was some kind of ﬁght inside, and when the sheriﬀ’s boys tried to go in to make an arrest, the soldiers forced the lawmen to leave. My cousin was there, and swears that a couple of those Aegis clerics stood up to them sheriﬀ’s boys, too. 

### Details
Governor-Mayor Lanod Neﬀ’s goons are no longer welcome on “soldier” property.
