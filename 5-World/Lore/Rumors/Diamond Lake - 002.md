## Overview
Governor-Mayor Lanod Neﬀ loathes the presence of the Twilight Monastery monks in his town, and plans to attack the monastery soon with the sheriﬀ’s boys and some mercenaries from the Ardentia City. 

### Details
Neﬀ loathes the monastery, but is too afraid of Izenfen to strike. He has employed no mercenaries from the Free City, but the presence of Auric, Tirra, and Khellek is probably to blame for the confusion.
