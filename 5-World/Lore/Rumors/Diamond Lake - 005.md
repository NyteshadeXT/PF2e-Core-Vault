## Overview
No one has seen Mestal Fixx, Balabar Smenk’s right-hand man, in more than two weeks. I might be imaginin’ things, but Smenk seems more on edge lately. I wonder if something big is about to happen? 

### Details
Last week, Balabar Smenk awoke from a pleasant night’s sleep to stare into the eyes of Mestal Fixx’s disembodied head, courtesy of a pack of grimlocks aligned with the Ebon Triad. Smenk fed the body to his dire apes, and nervously maintains that Fixx is away on business.
