## Overview
Last week me mate Barwik were on the Elmshire Road when he come across a dozen armored warriors. They weren’t the garrison militia, neither. Had a ﬂag with the symbol of Manzorian the Archmage, what lives near Elmshire. Barwik thinks he plans to invade Diamond Lake!

### Details
The archmage has indeed marshaled a force in the northern hills, but he has no ambitions upon Diamond Lake.
