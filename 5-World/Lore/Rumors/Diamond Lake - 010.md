## Overview
I hear that one of the freaks escaped his cage at the Emporium. Crazy little bugger called “Demon Boy.” Bright red skin, obsessed with ﬁre, you can’t miss ’im. Word is Shag Solomon will pay 10 pieces of gold to the ﬁrst one what can turn ‘im in. 

### Details
Unfortunately for would-be bounty hunters, the nasty little creature has already departed [[Diamond Lake]] to ﬁnd fame and fortune in the free-wheeling [[Ardentia City]].
