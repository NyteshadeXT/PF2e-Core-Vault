# The Age of Dawn

In the beginning, the world of Aetheria was a raw and untamed expanse of elemental chaos. From this primordial soup arose the Primordials, colossal beings of pure elemental power. They embodied the primal forces of nature: fire, water, earth, air, and ether. Their presence sculpted the world, creating mountains, oceans, forests, and skies, but also leaving it volatile and dangerous.

For eons, the Primordials ruled Aetheria, their titanic forms shifting landscapes and causing natural disasters as they pleased. Their dominion was absolute, and no other creatures dared challenge their might. Yet, within the chaotic energy of the world, seeds of order began to take root, giving rise to the fledgling gods.

From the remnants of creation's chaos, the gods emerged. They were born from the dreams and desires of the world's nascent sentient beings. The gods, though not as physically powerful as the Primordials, wielded a different kind of power: the ability to shape reality through will and thought. They represented abstract concepts such as life, death, knowledge, and war.

While the gods were finding their footing, another powerful race stirred: the ancient dragons. Born from the world's elemental forces but shaped by time and intelligence, these dragons were mighty and wise. They sought to carve out their own dominion, separate from both Primordials and gods.

# The War of Supremacy

The tension between the Primordials, gods, and dragons eventually erupted into a colossal conflict known as the War of Supremacy. Each faction fought to assert their dominance over Aetheria.  The Primordials sought to return the world to its primal, unstructured state. The Gods aimed to create a harmonious realm where they could nurture their followers and establish order. The Dragons desired to reign supreme as the ultimate beings of power and wisdom.

The war raged for millennia, reshaping the world repeatedly. Entire continents rose and fell, and the skies were set ablaze with dragon fire and divine lightning. Realizing that continued conflict would lead to mutual destruction, the factions forged an uneasy truce. The Primordials retreated to the most remote and untouched corners of Aetheria, where their influence remains strong. The gods established celestial realms, overseeing the world from afar and guiding their mortal followers. The dragons, now few but immensely powerful, chose to withdraw to hidden sanctuaries, guarding ancient knowledge and treasures.

# The Age of Mortals

In the wake of the War of Supremacy, the world of Aetheria was a land ripe for the rise of new life and civilizations. Mortals began to explore and settle the lands, guided by the subtle influences of the gods and occasionally encountering the remnants of primordial power. The early civilizations were simple, often built around sources of natural power or ancient ruins left by the gods and dragons.

One of the first great human kingdoms, Elysor, was founded in the fertile plains near what was then known as the River Elaria. Blessed by the goddess of harvest, Demetia, Elysor became known for its abundant crops and vibrant culture. Its people were the first to develop written language and recorded history, spreading knowledge across Aetheria.

  Deep in the enchanted forests, the elves of Sylvanor established a realm in harmony with nature. They were led by archdruids who claimed to have communed with the gods and received their blessings. Sylvanor became a center for magic and learning, where scholars and mages from across Aetheria would gather.

In the mountainous regions, the dwarves of Karak-Zhul carved out vast underground cities, mining the rich veins of precious metals and gems. Known for their craftsmanship and engineering prowess, the dwarves created wonders of stone and metal, including intricate weapons and fortified cities.

As these early civilizations grew, so did their ambitions. The discovery of ancient relics and powerful artifacts from the time of the Primordials, gods, and dragons fueled expansion and conflict.

The rise of powerful mages and the discovery of ancient magical tomes led to the Arcane Wars. Rival kingdoms and city-states vied for control over sources of magical power. This period was marked by devastating battles and the creation of forbidden spells that could alter the fabric of reality itself.

Some mortal rulers, driven by greed and the promise of power, sought out the hidden sanctuaries of the ancient dragons. These Dragon Hunts were perilous and often led to the ruin of those who embarked on them. However, a few successful hunts brought back immense treasures and knowledge, advancing the civilizations that dared to face the dragons.

The presence of mortals disturbed the slumber of the Primordials. Occasionally, these ancient beings would awaken, causing natural disasters and chaos. Heroes and champions arose to confront these threats, often at great personal cost. These events were rare but served as a stark reminder of the raw power that still lingered in Aetheria.

Despite the conflicts, this era also saw unprecedented growth and prosperity for many civilizations.

To prevent further destructive wars, the most powerful kingdoms formed the Council of Elarion, named after the ancient river. This council aimed to mediate disputes, promote trade, and encourage the sharing of knowledge. It was a beacon of hope and cooperation in a world still scarred by past conflicts.

# The Shattering and Its Aftermath

In the waning years of the Age of Mortals, the Lords of Chaos, ancient beings of immense and malevolent power, sought to increase their influence over Aetheria. They thrived on discord and strife, their very essence feeding on the chaos they sowed. Among them, [[Kataklysmos]], a being of catastrophic power, hatched a plan to assert dominance over both Aetheria and the celestial realms.

[[Kataklysmos]] discovered a way to manipulate the ley lines, the mystical currents of energy that crisscrossed the planet. By redirecting a massive meteor to strike Aetheria, he aimed to overload these ley lines with raw, uncontrolled energy. His intention was to absorb this energy, using it to gain unmatched power and to subjugate the celestial beings.

The warning signs were subtle at first: fluctuations in magical energy, unexplained natural phenomena, and increased seismic activity. Scholars and mages across Aetheria began to notice these anomalies, but the true scale of the impending disaster was beyond their comprehension.

As the meteor hurtled towards Aetheria, the skies grew dark, and the air crackled with unstable magic. Before impacting Aetheria, the meteor crashed through one of Aetheria's moons, sending debris raining down to the planet and creating a ring of rocky debris in orbit. When the meteor finally struck Aetheria, it was with a force that defied imagination. The impact shattered mountains, evaporated seas, and unleashed a wave of magical energy that surged through the ley lines. This cataclysmic event became known as The Shattering.

The Shattering was devastating. Entire civilizations were obliterated, and the landscape of Aetheria was radically transformed. The ley lines, now overloaded with energy, ruptured in a chain reaction of magical explosions. This energy backlash affected both the physical and the magical fabric of the world.

Continents were torn apart, new landmasses emerged, and others sank into the ocean. The geography of Aetheria was forever changed, with vast wastelands, new mountain ranges, and enchanted forests appearing almost overnight. The magical energies released by The Shattering created zones of wild magic where the laws of nature were distorted. These areas became hazardous, with unpredictable magical effects that could transform or destroy anything that entered. The surviving populations were scattered and disoriented. Kingdoms and cities were reduced to rubble, and many fled to safer regions. The struggle to survive in this new, chaotic world began immediately, with communities forming around remaining sources of stability and power.

# The Barrier of the Gods

In the wake of The Shattering, the gods realized that their continued direct interaction with mortals could exacerbate the instability of the fractured world. To prevent further chaos and to protect Aetheria, the deities erected a powerful barrier between themselves and the mortal realm. This barrier, known as the Veil, not only kept the gods from directly intervening in mortal affairs but also served to hold the fractured lands of Aetheria together, preventing them from spinning out into the universe.

However, in their haste and focus on containing the immediate crisis, the gods made a critical oversight. They forgot to account for the Primordials, the ancient elemental beings who had shaped the world in its earliest days. As a result, the Primordials were not blocked by the Veil and remained free to roam Aetheria, their immense powers lay dormant to be discovered and unleashed upon the world.

# The Present

The decade following The Shattering was a period of intense struggle and adaptation. The survivors faced numerous challenges as they tried to rebuild and understand the new world around them. Efforts to rebuild began almost immediately. Kingdoms and empires that survived the initial devastation worked to restore order, rebuild infrastructure, and provide for their people. This era saw the rise of new leaders and heroes who emerged to guide their people through the chaos.

Adventurers, scholars, and mages set out to explore the newly transformed lands. They mapped out the new geography, identified zones of wild magic, and sought out remnants of lost civilizations. This period of exploration was crucial for understanding the new Aetheria. The Shattering had a profound impact on religious and spiritual beliefs. Many saw it as a divine judgment or a cosmic reset. Temples and churches became centers of refuge and guidance, and new religious movements emerged, seeking to explain and find meaning in the cataclysm.

Major organizations were formed to adapt to the new reality of Aetheria. Two of the most significant are [[Arcane Exchange Consortium]] and the [[Dungeon Seekers Guild]]. [[Arcane Exchange Consortium]] is a sprawling global network that thrives on the symbiosis between seekers, magical artisans, and curious townsfolk.

The [[Dungeon Seekers Guild]] stands as a beacon for those who crave adventure, seek forgotten knowledge, and thrive in the heart of danger. Their banners flutter across continents, and their name echoes through taverns and royal courts alike. The guild's primary purpose is to explore dungeons in any of their various forms—subterranean labyrinths, cursed crypts, and forgotten temples. They seek to uncover relics, unravel magical mysteries, and reclaim Creature Cores from defeated foes and Dungeon Cores when necessary. The [[Dungeon Seekers Guild]] has an excellent relationship with [[Arcane Exchange Consortium]], ensuring a steady flow of Creature Cores and magical artifacts while benefiting from access to cutting-edge magical equipment and resources.

A decade after The Shattering, Aetheria remains a land of profound contrasts. It is a world where the echoes of ancient powers mingle with the scars of recent cataclysm, creating an environment rich in danger and opportunity. New heroes rise to face the challenges of this era, driven by the hope of rebuilding a better world from the ruins of the old. The balance of power is tenuous, with the remnants of the Lords of Chaos still lurking in the shadows, the gods watching from beyond the Veil, and the dragons guarding their ancient hoards. The Primordials, unchecked by the divine barrier, continue to pose a slumbering threat. Aetheria stands on the brink of a new age, its future shaped by the resilience and determination of its people as they navigate the perils and possibilities of their transformed world.
