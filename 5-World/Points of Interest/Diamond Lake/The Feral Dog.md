## Overview 
The Feral Dog is a sleazy tavern on the Vein's central square.  Every night and especially when the workforces of several local mines let out at the same time, cheering laborers within the bar scream obscenities and wave betting vouchers over two dogs in a lethal pit fight.  No one savors the tinny ale, but the place is more about camaraderie, bravado and desperation than about expecting exemplary quality or service.

## Notes
A gang of criminals indentured to the corrupt mine manager Balabar Smenk casts a broad shadow over the Feral Dog's squalid taproom.  The patrons know form experience to respect the word of Kullen, the silently seething albino half-orc who leads the motley band with little tolerance for insolence and a powerful backhand.

Arguments commonly erupt at the Feral Dog, especially during the dog fights, when betting often grows contentious and even violent.  About once a moth, a drunk miner falls or is pushed into the thrashing dog pit, with predictably tragic results.  During the worst brawls, someone usually gets knifed.  A festering garbage pit in the sharp crags behind the building is said to hold the corpses of as many humans as dogs.

The dagger tossing contest consists of three rounds, during which an unlimited number of contestants take turns throwing a house-provided dagger into a large wooden target on a wall 25 feet away.  The target consists of two wide concentric rings around a central circle.  All players agree upon a common wager (3 sp is typical).  IN the first round, each contestant attempts to strike within the largest ring, requiring a ranged attack against AC 10.  Anyone who fails to do so is eliminated.  IN subsequent rounds, contestants attempt to strike within the inner ring (AC 15) and the central circle (AC 20).  The last contestant to resist elimination wins the pool, with play focusing on the central circle until only one player is left.
