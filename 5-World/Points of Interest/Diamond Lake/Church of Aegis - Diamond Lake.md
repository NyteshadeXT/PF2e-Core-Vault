## Notes
Because Wierus is so frequently absent due to his seclusion, PCs visiting the visiting the church for healing must deal with a secondary acolyte such as the scrupulous Hameneezer.  After religious ceremonies, Hameneezer often soaks the congregation's congealing blood into rags, which are later sold as holy relics of the faith.  Hameneezer and an assortment of acolytes also offer healing potions and spellcasting services to the general public at standard rates.  Members of the flock receive these boons for half price, so the faithful constantly drone on about the value of regularly attending church services.

Wierus performs three sermons a week; each fills to capacity at least an hour before the high priest arrives and is a rambunctious affair.  Not all devotees whip themselves into religious fervor, but enough do that those who abstain mark themselves as outsiders.  Wierus views new arrivals as thrilling challenges, and tailor his sermons to the first-time visitors, urging them to join his growing congregation and reclaim Diamond Lake under the banner of community and strong values.  "Dark times is coming," he says, eyes afire. "Writhing times.
