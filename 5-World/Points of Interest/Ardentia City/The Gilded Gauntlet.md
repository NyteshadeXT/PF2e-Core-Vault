> [!recite]- Introduction
> Sparks rain like golden fireflies from the open forge, their light dancing across polished armor and rune-etched blades. The rhythmic clang of hammer on steel resonates through the street. Darrin Ironsoul, his left arm replaced with gleaming Aetherium plating, nods in greeting from behind the counter.

## Overview 
A masterwork forge producing arms and armor designed for Dungeon delving. Darrin’s creations balance practical function and magical enhancement—each bearing his maker’s mark: a gauntlet clutching a rune.

- **Atmosphere:** Industrial heat, rhythmic hammering, faint smell of ozone and oil.
- **Products:** Reinforced adventuring gear, rune-bound weapons, climbing tools, Aetherium-threaded mail.
- **Customers:** Seekers, mercenaries, and Arcane Exchange security.

## Keyed Locations

> [!kirk|info] Prompt (Remove me)
Create detailed descriptions for each keyed location within the Point Of Interest. Define each room or area with distinct characteristics. Include information on the size, layout, notable features, and potential points of interaction or interest within each location. Describe the ambiance, potential hazards, objects of importance, any interactive elements that might engage the players, or any loot to be found. How does each keyed location contribute to the overall exploration and gameplay experience within this Point of Interest?

The main forge is an Aetherium furnaces which burn clean blue; a semi-sentient hammer assists the smith.  While in the showroom there are displays of animated armor performing maneuvers to demonstrate various enchantments. 

Darrin's private workshop and personal forge is off-limits to customers and rumored to house *Iron Pact* relics.

## Current Events
Darrin is crafting an “unbreakable” shield commissioned by [[Belegar Cragstone]], intended for use in the next Observatory expedition. Strange runic whispers echo from his forge at night.

## History
Once a Seeker himself, Darrin lost his arm to a mana implosion within the Aetherial Observatory. He reforged his limb using Aetherium, merging flesh and forge—a symbol of the Quarter’s spirit.
