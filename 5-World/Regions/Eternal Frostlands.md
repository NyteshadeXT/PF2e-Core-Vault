The Eternal Frostlands present a stark and haunting landscape within the fractured world of Aetheria, where eternal winter reigns and ancient secrets lie buried beneath the ice. This land of beauty and danger is home to frost-resistant creatures that roam amidst towering glaciers and hidden dungeons, awaiting those brave enough to seek them out.

Marked by the meteor's impact, the Eternal Frostlands are plunged into perpetual winter. Snow and ice blanket the landscape, creating a desolate environment where temperatures plummet to bone-chilling depths. The sun's feeble rays struggle to penetrate thick clouds, casting the land into perpetual twilight.

The landscape is punctuated by ice formations, towering glaciers, and shimmering ice caves. These natural wonders pose constant threats with treacherous crevasses and sudden avalanches lurking amidst the frozen expanse.

Despite the harsh conditions, the Eternal Frostlands are home to a hardy array of frost-resistant creatures that have adapted to thrive in the frozen tundra. From resilient ice bears to elusive snow foxes, these creatures have evolved specialized adaptations to withstand the bitter cold and scarce resources of their icy habitat. Yet, they remain fierce predators, their survival dependent on their ability to hunt and outmaneuver their prey.

Within the heart of the Eternal Frostlands lie hidden crystalline structures, their icy facades shimmering with arcane energy. These structures, remnants of the meteor's impact, are infused with potent magical properties. Elusive and enigmatic, their true purpose and significance remain shrouded in mystery. Explorers who brave the frozen wastes may stumble upon these crystalline formations, unlocking their secrets and harnessing their power for their own ends.
