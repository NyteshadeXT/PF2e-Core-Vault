Combining "Aether," a reference to the elemental and magical forces, with "Fracta," reflecting the fractured nature of the world.

The Chaos Lord, [[Kataklysmos]], guided a celestial projectile to collide with Aetheria. The other higher powers of the world were caught off guard, their response too late. The impact of this object splintered Aetheria into myriad fragments, tearing the veil between our world and other planes of existence.  Ley lines, conduits of magic, fractured, releasing their arcane energy into the atmosphere. Ambient magic surged, altering the very fabric of reality.  Strange Primal Crystals began to grow throughout the land trapping elemental energies now readily available.  Once-mighty kingdoms crumbled as their lands broke away. Survival became a brutal contest where only the strongest endured.

Seekers, drawn by curiosity and necessity, discovered monsters evolving into terrible new forms. Within these creatures, strange objects called Creature Cores formed, condensing mana and bestowing enhanced strength, stamina, and powerful abilities. Sages theorized that Creature Cores were a byproduct of the heightened ambient magic, making them highly coveted by magic users and crafters for their potential in spellcasting and magic item creation.

Over the next decade, a new mystery began to unfold: the spontaneous emergence of Dungeons. Unlike pre-Fracturing ancient ruins, these enigmatic structures sprouted across the land.  They teemed with foes, traps, and wondrous treasures. Seekers, undeterred by the danger these Dungeons presented, sought their secrets.  It was quickly discovered that creatures within these Dungeons were mana-formed, their demise leaving behind precious Creature Cores. 

Each Dungeon harbored a final challenge. Conquer it, and its Dungeon Seed could be claimed—a wellspring of magic and mystery. Alternatively, leaving the Dungeon Seed undisturbed allowed new creatures, challenges, and treasures to form, perpetuating the cycle anew.

With this knowledge, cities and guilds quickly organized around some Dungeons as enterprising people began to understand the value of proper Dungeon management.  Other factions saw Dungeons as dangerous and dedicated themselves to their destruction.  Markets for dungeon resources quickly began to emerge and [[Arcane Exchange Consortium]] emerged as a beacon for seekers. Their versatility and foresight made them the preferred trade guild. Not content with merely gathering Creature Cores, however, they supported seekers by reselling and distributing goods and other items. Branches of the Consortium spread across major city-states, their influence echoing far and wide.  The Consortium catalyzed a new era by introducing adventuring charters. These magical contracts bound groups of seekers to follow strictures set forth by the guild. In return, seekers gained access to resources, protection, and the Consortium’s vast network. For certain factions, conquering a Dungeon transcended mere ambition—it became a divine mandate.  The challenges within these enigmatic structures held cultural and religious significance. Victorious groups emerged not only with power but also with legitimacy and influence.

As scholars experimented with Creature Cores and Primal Crystals, new innovations emerged. Flying ships, powered by Primal Crystals, revolutionized trade and communication between the fledgling kingdoms and city-states of Aetheria. These ships overcame geographical barriers, enabling faster and more efficient trade routes. Previously isolated regions could now engage in commerce and cultural exchange, fostering economic growth and cooperation.

The ability of flying ships to soar above the fractured landscape of Aetheria granted seekers and explorers unprecedented access to remote and uncharted territories. Seekers would embark on expeditions venturing into unknown regions, seeking out hidden dungeons, primal crystal deposits, and other mysteries. The promise of discovery, untold riches and mystical secrets fuels the spirit of adventure and drives the exploration of this new land. 

Flying ships held strategic significance in the fractured geopolitical landscape of Aetheria. Kingdoms and city-states vied for control over air routes and skyports, seeking trade monopolies, strategic alliances, and military superiority. The ability to project power and influence across vast distances gave those who commanded flying ships a considerable advantage in shaping the destiny of the world.

In this new era, Aetheria is a land of chaos and opportunity, where magic flows freely, and the brave and resourceful can carve out their destiny amidst the fractured remnants of the old world.
